  blurb:
  - >
    At Stanford, Mirador is being used by a range of library staff, scholars and instructors, and has been implemented as a viewer option within the Spotlight exhibits platform.  The cultural, educational and research potential of Mirador is vast, but the codebase and user interface of Mirador 2 had reached the point where it is prohibitively difficult to extend in a sustainable and maintainable way.  The current Mirador 3 effort is intended to rebuild and re-architect Mirador to fully realize its potential for Stanford and beyond.

    [Europeana](https://www.europeana.eu), Europe's platform for digital cultural heritage,
    encourages its network of partners (libraries, archives, museums) to provide access
    to high-quality content. They have started to encourage data providers to adopt IIIF,
    and have adapted their infrastructure so that it can handle IIIF resources. The first
    IIIF datasets following the agreed Europeana guidelines for IIIF can be accessed on the
    [Europeana Collections portal](https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/search?view=grid&q=sv_dcterms_conformsTo%3A*iiif*).
