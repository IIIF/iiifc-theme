- abstract: <p>The presentation will start with the current status of the work at
    Europeana with respect discovery of IIIF cultural heritage resources. We will
    present how IIIF resources may be provided by Europeana data providers in the
    EDM metadata delivered to Europeana. </p><p>IIIF is also recognized by Europeana
    as a technology with much potential to innovate the process of aggregation of
    metadata within the Europeana network, and reducing the operational costs of metadata
    aggregation for all partners. Europeana has already has collections in its dataset
    that were aggregated via several of the possible IIIF methods. Europeana is interested
    in the IIIF Change Discovery API for establishing a standard metadata aggregation
    method based on IIIF, is active in its specification and in the work being carried
    out in the IIIF Discovery Technical Working Group </p><p>We will conclude by presenting
    future plans, for example our investigation of the potential uses, for Europeana's
    services, of the recent IIIF progress at Wikidata. </p>

    \ in order to automatically recognize handwritten and printed documents. There\
    \ is no restriction regarding the age, style, script or language of the documents.\
    \ Codices from the Middle Ages can be processed in the same way as modern manuscripts,\
    \ languages such as ancient Greek, Latin or Hebrew do not impose more challenges\
    \ than modern English, German or Arabic. Transkribus is designed as an open platform\
    \ in order to support the collaboration among scholars, computer scientists, archives,\
    \ libraries and the public. The assumption is that the more data there is in the\
    \ platform, the higher will be the benefit for all users. In February 2019 more\
    \ than 20,000 users were registered in the platform, hundreds of them actively\
    \ transcribing documents. More than seventy institutions, such as universities,\
    \ research groups, archives, and libraries have concluded collaboration agreements\
    \ indicating their interest in the platform and the technology. In January 2019\
    \ more than 220 text recognition models were successfully trained by Transkribus\
    \ users, indicating their diverse interests and competences. In order to sustain\
    \ the service platform several universities and institutions around Europe will\
    \ set up a European Cooperative Society. This legal entity will enable the team\
    \ to further develop the platform and offer services on a new scale. See M\xFC\
    hlberger et al (Forthcoming 2019) for an overview. </p><p>One of the new services\
    \ will be to explore the options to connect the IIIF technology and community\
    \ with the Transkribus platform. We can think on several scenarios: First of all\
    \ a simple \u201Cupload\u201D mechanism for transferring images from a IIIF server\
    \ to the Transkribus platform would enable libraries and archives to enrich their\
    \ holdings with textual data. The simple delivery of the ID of the manifest would\
    \ start a job a text recognition job at Transkribus. In return an updated manifest\
    \ could be either delivered to the hosting institution, or the manifest could\
    \ also be made available via a IIIF server based within the Transkribus environment.\
    \ Secondly transcription interfaces \u2013 as they are increasingly developed\
    \ at several institutions on basis of IIIF technology \u2013 may be connected\
    \ with the Transkribus API in order to not only request a recognition job, but\
    \ also to use the transcribed texts as training material for machine learning\
    \ processes. Other options include the making available of all images within Transkribus\
    \ (daily upload of users is currently around 5000 images) via IIIF, or to even\
    \ move specific features, such as training or evaluation functionalities into\
    \ a IIIF based web-interface.</p><p>The presentation will discuss the several\
    \ options and invite the audience to come up with their own ideas and suggestions\
    \ as to how these two communities and frameworks can work together.</p><p>Muehlberger,\

    \ Knowledge. Crossing institutional boundaries with IIIF.</p><p>The Public Library\
    \ of Bruges, Ghent University Library, Grand Seminar Bruges, and Diocese of Ghent\
    \ are collaborating on Mmmonk. The aim of this IIIF project is to digitally reunite\
    \ the 734 medieval manuscripts of the abolished Cistercian abbeys of Ten Duinen\
    \ and Ter Doest and the Benedictine abbeys of Saint Bavo and Saint Peter in Flanders.\
    \ </p><p>For Mmmonk, the PL Bruges and UL Ghent, two active special collections\
    \ libraries in Flanders, join forces with the Grand Seminar Bruges and the Diocese\
    \ of Ghent. These two religious institutions hold extremely valuable manuscripts\
    \ but lack the expertise and resources to disclose them according to international\
    \ standards. </p><p>In the first phase of the project (March 2019 \u2013 September\
    \ 2020), recently awarded with a grant by the Flemish Government, all of the manuscripts\
    \ kept in Ghent and Bruges will be digitised and made available online using IIIF.\
    \ These building blocks will allow us to develop research and annotation options\
    \ enabled by IIIF and computer vision, tailored to our unique corpus of coherent\
    \ medieval monastic libraries. An example includes the use of multi-lingual ontologies\
    \ to enrich the metadata provided in the IIIF manifest. All manuscripts will be\
    \ gathered in a virtual library on an online platform, which will also provide\
    \ context about the collections.</p><p>Although the majority of these manuscripts\
    \ are now kept at the libraries of the four main partners, some 60 manuscripts\
    \ from these abbeys have been identified in about 40 institutions in Belgium and\
    \ abroad. In the following phase of the project, we wish to add these manuscripts\
    \ to the virtual library as well. Where there are no IIIF compliant images available\
    \ yet, we hope our project will stimulate and, if possible, support their creation.\
    \ </p><p>Outreach and education are important aspects of the project. We aim to\
    \ develop a IIIF manual for special collections libraries that wish to implement\
    \ this digital innovation. In doing so, we hope to contribute to the development\
    \ of a general open data culture hub in Flanders, but also to take up an exemplary\
    \ role in stimulating collaboration between smaller and larger institutions in\
    \ order to facilitate digital innovation. Last but not least, we will combine\
    \ our academic, public and religious networks to advocate for the use of IIIF\
    \ in research, education and public outreach (e.g. by crowdsourcing and teaching\
    \ initiatives).</p><p>A supportive network of ten partners will provide additional\
    \ expertise in terms of digital innovation, education, research and outreach,\
    \ and will ensure a wide reach for our message and results. </p><p>During a lightning\

- abstract: "<p>The need for interoperable platforms to share cultural heritage information\
    \ is an important aspect in the digital realm, especially for cultural heritage\
    \ institutions that are federating collections and reuniting them in the digital\
    \ realm. The Council on Library and Information Resources (CLIR) has long promoted\
    \ interoperability and the need for sustainable open source data practices for\
    \ digital initiatives.  CLIR is an independent, nonprofit organization that forges\
    \ strategies to enhance research, teaching, and learning environments in collaboration\
    \ with libraries, cultural institutions, and communities of higher learning. With\
    \ many initiatives becoming more globally focused, the need for linked open usable\
    \ data (LOUD) becomes critical for true collaboration and cooperation. The mission\
    \ of CLIR is to be \u201Cexplicit in wanting to influence the collective behaviors,\
    \ politics, and technological advancements that can contribute to a more sustainable\
    \ intellectual environment. Projects such as the Digitization of Hidden Collections;\
    \ the postdoctoral fellowships in data curation, which now encompass more than\
    \ 20 academic disciplines; and the Digital Library of the Middle East all require\
    \ years of execution in order to help reshape and invigorate our inherited academic\
    \ milieu\u201D (Charles Henry, President, CLIR).</p><p>The audience for library,\
    \ archive and museum collections is increasingly diverse, with researchers running\
    \ the gamut from public, academic, federal and increasingly,  collaborative research\
    \ groups. One of the recent CLIR international ventures is the Digital Library\
    \ of the Middle East (DLME), an initiative to federate and connect dispersed collections\
    \ to make these available for relocated populations from conflict zones, and allow\
    \ for the digital access and connection of these collections in institutions around\
    \ the world. Pangia, an international collaborative effort to create a global\
    \ digital library, is next on CLIR\u2019s horizon.</p><p>Part of the new focus\
    \ for these and other initiatives is the need for interoperable and open source\
    \ tools for reuse of data and through these tools, re-engaging users with new\
    \ ways of using data \u2013 from economic impact to integrated humanities and\
    \ heritage science data. CLIR has worked not only to create platforms for global\
    \ initiatives, but also to develop the workforce to we need to make these aspirations\
    \ into realities, through its CLIR/Mellon dissertation and postdoctoral fellows,\
    \ its Leading Change Institute (a partnership with EDUCAUSE) and its Postdoctoral\
    \ Fellows Program that is dedicated to digital curation.</p><p>Research data created\
    \ from collections and needed for preserving these collections is inherently multi-disciplinary,\
    \ drawing colleagues from a diverse range of fields \u2013 history, literature,\
    \ humanities, chemistry, physics, material science, engineering, and archeology,\
    \ to name a few. The need for authoritative linked open data (LOD) is critical\
    \ to enable efficient collaboration and accurate sharing of research data between\
    \ aligned fields. Currently a Data Visualization Project Initiative (DVP) has\
    \ created a cloud-based integration of scientific data analyses linked to geo-located\
    \ data on a visual rendering of the heritage object. This initiative uses the\
    \ International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF), expanding the framework\
    \ and open access through the Mirador viewer to include scientific data from a\
    \ range of disciplines. One of the challenges with including the scientific and\
    \ humanities data is linking to authoritative sources for instrumentation, methods,\
    \ and scientific definitions, terminology and vocabulary within the IIIF framework.\
    \ The initiative is also focused on creating datasets that are reusable and active,\
    \ rather than static data created for one purpose.</p>"

- abstract: <p>Description of the workshop</p><p>Our comprehensive, hands-on Goobi
    IIIF workshop is designed to give all participants the skills they need to generate
    valid, standardised metadata from directories containing images using very simple
    resources in less than 20 minutes and without further help. The metadata can then
    be exported as METS/MODS (libraries), LIDO (museums) or even in TEI format for
    digital humanities. At the same time, Goobi-to-go automatically generates valid
    IIIF Presentation manifests. That means the images are immediately available via
    the IIIF Image API and can be used straight away in any number of other IIIF consumers
    (e.g. Mirador). </p><p>In the second part of the workshop, participants will gain
    an insight into our current developments using IIIF interfaces in combination
    with machine-learning techniques for various purposes, e.g. to perform image and
    full text analyses.</p><p>Background</p><p>Goobi is an open-source application.
    For over 14 years, it has brought together many cultural institutions in currently
    17 countries as part of a single digitisation community, focusing equally on the
    coordination of both simple and complex workflows (Goobi workflow) for digitisation
    projects and on the publication of the digitised results of those projects (Goobi
    viewer). Alongside standardised interfaces such as OAI-PMH and SRU, IIIF plays
    a crucial role in ensuring interoperability between published digital collections
    and different external data consumers. In light of the growing interaction with
    the burgeoning field of digital humanities, the Goobi community needed to make
    its numerous portals and the collections of many different cultural institutions
    available in readily consumable form for research purposes. With this in mind,
    Goobi already supports the IIIF Image API 2.1, IIIF Presentation API 2.1 and IIIF
    Change Discovery API in draft status as well as Web Annotations und Open Annotations
    for use in the context of crowdsourcing.</p><p>Goobi does much more than simply
    provide a range of data for other systems and consumers. In fact, the whole Goobi
    community is now increasingly focused on the use of IIIF APIs in new scenarios.
    In particular, Goobi makes good use of these interfaces in various ongoing development
    projects that can harness machine-learning processes to identify or generate new
    data. Machine-learning techniques based on pattern recognition and text analysis
    have already been used in the past to recognise publication types and segment
    content indices. However, now that data can be obtained from standardised interfaces,
    these techniques are no longer dependent solely on locally stored data from the
    file system. Equally, the Goobi community now benefits enormously from the latest
    OCR developments in Tesseract, although without further training data those developments
    cannot yet provide the desired recognition quality. Working without IIIF is no
    longer a viable option, whether your development project involves using machine-learning
    techniques to generate ground truth data and extract illustrations or creating
    synthetic texts with unusual fonts based on text segments and letter coordinates.
    Over the last two years in particular, it has become clear within the Goobi community
    that various IIIF interfaces will be needed if newer projects and therefore newer
    research data are to be viable in the long term.</p>

- abstract: <p>Indiana University, in collaboration with Digirati, is using IIIF specs
    in its implementation of a newer version of the now retired Variations Audio Timeliner,
    an audio annotation and analysis tool for creating and labeling bubble diagrams.
    These diagrams, called Timelines, can be used to navigate music or other audio
    for detailed study.</p><p>The bubbles correspond to musical segments and serve
    as visual cues that help the quick identification of elements that recur or relate
    in the large-scale formal structure of a musical piece. Music instructors can
    provide their analyses to students, helping them develop critical listening skills.
    Students can also interact with the tool and create their own timeline.</p><p>The
    new Timeliner is a different type of IIIF client given its music teaching and
    learning use case. IIIF Presentation API v.3, which incorporated support for A/V
    content, is well suited for the representation of the Timeliner annotations. </p><p>At
    Indiana University, the audio content is stored in the Avalon Media System, which
    also provides the discovery and access to the content. The integration of Avalon
    and the Timeliner is facilitated by the IIIF Presentation v3 and Auth v1 APIs.
    For Auth, we implemented the Probe service suggested in https://github.com/IIIF/api/issues/1290.
    </p><p>This presentation will include a demo of the tool.</p>

    will provide the information needed to discover and subsequently make use of IIIF
    resources.  To exercise the developing API, OCLC Research deployed an experimental
    "Change Discovery Service" in December 2018, which enabled API access to 13 million
    CONTENTdm IIIF resources and included a demonstration user interface to test the
    utility of indexes built from the API-accessible IIIF resource data.  This experimental
    work has confirmed the benefits of standardization around the IIIF Change Discovery
    API.  It has also highlighted the metadata analysis and synthesis challenges of
    working with heterogeneous IIIF resource descriptions in a large aggregation,
    while testing potential search-and-retrieval remedies. This discussion will summarize
    OCLC Research's development efforts and report our findings from this early experimental

- abstract: '<p>Festivals are significant events in the social and cultural reality
    of apeople. To preserve cultural heritage, specialists capture what happens before,
    during, and after a festival by interviewing participants, taking photographs
    and recording audio and video of the event, etc. For example, Pelu Awofeso has
    documented the Lagos Eyo Festival (also known as the Adamo Orisha Play) in his
    work White Lagos: A Definitive and Visual Guide to the Eyo Festival, in which
    he observes</p><p>participants and uses a narratological approach to document
    the event in textual form. In this paper, I argue that the use of digital software
    such as IIIF, will be useful in both documenting as well as digitizing images
    for mapping and annotation. These processes will enhance the preservation, data
    protection, and privacy of textual documentation of festivals.</p>'

- abstract: "<p>Even though the creation of digital heritage collections began with\
    \ the acquisition in image mode, several decades later to search in the content\
    \ of some of these images still belongs to a more or less distant future. This\
    \ apparent paradox originates in two facts: digital libraries (DLs) first focused\
    \ on applying OCR to their printed materials, which renders major services in\
    \ terms of information retrieval; Searching in large collections of images remains\
    \ a technical challenge, despite the efforts of the scientific community to address\
    \ the underlying challenging tasks. However, the needs are very real, if one believes\
    \ user surveys or statistical studies of user behavior. But DLs images collections\
    \ are generally inadequate, given the broad spectrum of areas of knowledge and\
    \ time periods surveyed by users. However, DLs are rich in many other iconographic\
    \ sources (e.g. newspapers and magazines). But organized in data silos that are\
    \ not interoperable, most often lacking the descriptors required for image search,\
    \ and exposed through text-oriented user interfaces. While the querying of iconographic\
    \ content poses specific chalenges, answers to various use cases, targets different\
    \ knowledge domains, and finally calls for specific human-machine interac-tions.\
    \ </p><p>This work presents a proposal for a solution to two of these challenges,\
    \ the creation of an encyclopedic heritage image database and its hybrid querying\
    \ modalities. It presents an ETL (extract-transform-load) approach to this need,\
    \ that aims to: Identify and extract iconography wherever it may be found, in\
    \ image collections but also in printed materials (on the condition that the collections\
    \ are IIIF compliant); Transform, harmonize and enrich the image descriptive metadata,\
    \ thanks to deep learning approaches and IIIF for images access: in-house Convolutional\
    \ Neural Network based classification model of images genres (map, picture, drawing,\
    \ comics\u2026) and SaS for visual analysis (IBM Watson, Google Cloud Vision);\
    \ Load it all into a web app dedicated to hybrid image retrieval. IIIF is used\
    \ as an end-to-end versatile tool (as inputs to the AI processing as well as resources\
    \ for the web app), and this use case is fully commented.</p><p>The approach is\
    \ pragmatic, since it involves leveraging existing digital resources, standard\
    \ DLs protocols (particulary IIIF) and (virtually) on-the-shelf AI technologies.\
    \ The resulting web app, GallicaPix, is showcasing WW1 iconographic materials\
    \ from two digital libraries (Gallica and the Wellcome Library, the last one harvested\
    \ thanks to Europeana). GallicaPix is referenced on Gallica Studio, the Gallica\
    \ Lab, for user testing. Its database is publicly avalaible on api.bnf.fr for\

- abstract: "<p>New and more affordable imaging techniques allowed to shift the focus\
    \ in  digitization of medieval manuscripts from outstanding samples/copies to\
    \ entire collections and libraries. The virtual reconstruction of dispersed medieval\
    \ libraries, such as the Bibliotheca Laureshamensis, are one result of these efforts.\
    \ Still, in many cases the basic data about the manuscripts in these collections\
    \ are described only by approximation. Dates are often as vague as an indication\
    \ of an entire century, places of origin are missing or hypothesized. Traditionally,\
    \ it is the discipline of palaeography, the study of ancient handwritings, that\
    \ was developed to address the challenge of dating and localizing scripts and\
    \ describing their historical development.</p><p>Because of the high level of\
    \ expertise required there are \u2013 and have been \u2013 only a few authorities\
    \ in the field. Parallel to the increasing amount of digitized materials, computational\
    \ methods to assist the manual work have been developed, turning palaeography\
    \ into digital palaeography, computer aided palaeography, or artificial palaeography.\
    \ The decisive reason for the application of computational approaches is not the\
    \ distrust in the opinion of these experts, but the fact that due to the growing\
    \ amount of data available, rethinking about the application of image analysis\
    \ becomes possible, and perhaps even inevitable.</p><p>Therefore, the project\
    \ \u201CDigital Forensics for Historical Documents\u201D (KNAW 2018-2021) attempts\
    \ to create a digital tool, based on a deep learning system, in which the unique\
    \ characteristics of a certain script sample will be matched with similar script\
    \ samples by making use of digitized manuscript collections available in the world\
    \ wide web and their IIIF APIs.</p><p>While methods of feature extraction regarding\
    \ the segmentation and comparison of single letters or groups of letters are time\
    \ consuming when it comes to larger amounts of image data, deep learning is the\
    \ technique of choice for processing a large number of historical written documents\
    \ . Large scale digitization projects of the past twenty years and the possibility\
    \ of exploitation with the help of the IIIF have substantially contributed to\
    \ reach the critical mass which allows the application of deep learning for the\
    \ study of medieval scripts.</p><p>Within a close collaboration between research\
    \ software engineering, digital humanities and expert knowledge in medieval script\
    \ we try to develop a system that aims to help scholars to find a date and place\
    \ of origin for medieval manuscript material, by searching available online collections\
    \ for script with similar features. The researcher can then consult the metadata\
    \ attached to those matches to build a hypothesis for his/her own handwritten\
    \ document.</p><p>The project is still in a phase of experimenting, of trial and\
    \ error. In our talk we would like to present the workflow of the project and\
    \ its latest outcomes. How does our project benefit from the global IIIF network,\
    \ and how is IIIF implemented in our own developments? What are the challenges\

- abstract: "<p>The need for interoperable platforms to share cultural heritage information\
    \ is an important aspect in the digital realm, especially with cultural heritage,\
    \ where research requires the collaboration of diverse disciplines. Heritage science\
    \ is the application of science and technology to heritage to improve the understanding,\
    \ engagement and long-term management of cultural heritage. The research data\
    \ created and needed for preserving heritage is inherently multi-disciplinary,\
    \ drawing scientists from a diverse range of fields \u2013 chemistry, physics,\
    \ material science, engineering, and archeology, to name a few. Heritage science\
    \ data is any information captured about cultural heritage material, from paintings,\
    \ sculptures, manuscripts, ceramics, and any other item including housing materials\
    \ and other environmental factors that exist in a library, archive, museum, art\
    \ gallery, or on a historic site. Monitoring of sites and environment as well\
    \ as tracking change over time is an important component that is part of heritage\
    \ science but also many other scientific research projects; from marine science,\
    \ to medicine, climate change and archaeology. The need for authoritative linked\
    \ open data (LOD) is critical to enable efficient collaboration and accurate sharing\
    \ of research data between aligned fields. LOD needs to be globally accessible,\
    \ interlinked, structured data, with the caveat that it can be accessed easily\
    \ and can expand the creation of knowledge without impacting the original data\
    \ source. Currently a Data Visualization Project Initiative (DVP) has created\
    \ a cloud-based integration of scientific data analyses linked to geo-located\
    \ data on a visual rendering of the heritage object. </p><p>This initiative uses\
    \ a commonly shared international infrastructure, the International Image Interoperability\
    \ Framework (IIIF), expanding the framework and open access through the Mirador\
    \ viewer to include scientific data from a range of science, technology, engineering\
    \ and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. One of the challenges with including the\
    \ scientific data is linking to authoritative sources for instrumentation, methods,\
    \ and scientific definitions, terminology and vocabulary, and ensuring this can\
    \ be done within the IIIF framework. A number of plug-in applications using complementary\
    \ software have expanded existing IIIF capabilities for linking and annotating\
    \ data layers. Avoiding reinventing the wheel for terminology has led to the exploration\
    \ of available LOD sources, and working with the challenges of integrating the\
    \ original source terminology, as well as assuring datasets that are reusable\
    \ and active, rather than static data created for one purpose. Discussions with\
    \ colleagues at other cultural heritage and research institutions \u2013 libraries,\
    \ archives, museums and art galleries, \u2013 have revealed similar challenges\
    \ with integrating LOD. Data and informatics and library colleagues at the National\
    \ Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) and other institutions have indicated\
    \ significant crossover between research data within chemistry, archaeology, materials\
    \ science, physics and other fields. Addressing the current capabilities for true\
    \ linked open data that exist within STEM disciplines to provide authoritative\
    \ sources will form the scope of the discussion around heritage science. Data\

- abstract: <p>One of the strengths of IIIF is interoperability. You can bring together
    digitized objects from different sources. In small scale, you can do this manually.
    But what to do if there are millions of IIIF objects from hundreds of institutions
    out there - how can you find and select objects within this mass? Let's talk about
    the necessary steps to enable IIIF content retrieval worldwide and cross-domain.</p>

- abstract: "<p>Biblissima, a digital facility for medieval and renaissance written\
    \ cultural heritage, is maintaining an experimental discovery environment to search\
    \ across IIIF-compliant collections of manuscripts and rare books (materials dated\
    \ before 1800). It is online at https://iiif.biblissima.fr/collections since December\
    \ 2018. The first version aggregates about 60,000 Manifests coming from many IIIF\
    \ repositories in Europe and beyond: Gallica (BnF), Digital.Bodleian, e-codices,\
    \ the BVMM, Parker on the Web, The Biblioth\xE8que Mazarine. More will follow\
    \ in the coming weeks.</p><p>The general approach of this prototype is not only\
    \ to harvest and index the Manifests\u2019 metadata as present at the source,\
    \ but also to reconcile, cluster and normalise some of the metadata elements in\
    \ order to perform powerful search capabilities and facets. This data processing\
    \ leverages the big cluster of medieval and early modern authorities which forms\
    \ the backbone of the main Biblissima portal (https://biblissima.fr).</p><p>Eventually\
    \ this application seeks to build on the work being done by the IIIF Discovery\
    \ Technical Specification group. We also intend to collaborate with the IIIF Manuscripts\
    \ community group to help promote best practices regarding search and discovery\
    \ of Manifests (e.g. use of the seeAlso property, use of profile identifiers),\
    \ define and share mappings between existing metadata formats. More broadly, it\
    \ can be seen as an experiment to make concrete progress towards live discovery\
    \ interfaces that allow users to search, browse and find IIIF resources kept in\
    \ institutional silos.</p><p>In this presentation, we will tackle the main technical\
    \ challenges we have faced while building this prototype: lack of a common mechanism\
    \ to harvest the Manifests from the IIIF providers, the infrequent use of \"seeAlso\"\
    \ links, the availability of structured metadata and the diversity of source formats\
    \ (even within the same domain, working on the same type of documents), the extreme\
    \ diversity of strings to represent the same named entity, without any reference\
    \ to linked open authority files... This is what we are trying to address in this\
    \ domain-specific prototype, based on our experience on the Biblissima portal.\
    \ We will then talk about the process by which we aggregate the data, and finally\
    \ present some potential development avenues for the web application.</p>"

- abstract: "<p>This talk introduces user-generated and shareable collections, based\
    \ on the IIIF API SACHA (Simple Access to Cultural Heritage Assets) and implemented\
    \ on the research platform ONB Labs. It further discusses technological intricacies\
    \ of these collections, such as the dynamic creation of IIIF manifests, and future\
    \ developments such as the implementation of individual annotations. These dynamic\
    \ and thus innovative applications of IIIF technologies aims to improve access\
    \ to culturally relevant data, such as the digitized historical book and newspaper\
    \ collection of the Austrian National Library, and thus facilitates research and\
    \ scholarly use.</p><p>SACHA, is a contribution to the European digital infrastructure\
    \ for the arts and humanities DARIAH, realized in cooperation of the Austrian\
    \ National Library and the Austrian Academy of Sciences. The corpus available\
    \ in SACHA contains approximately 600.000 digitized historical books (https://www.onb.ac.at/digitale-bibliothek-kataloge/austrian-books-online-abo),\
    \ 34.800 digitized postcards and 218.000 historical newspaper issues.</p><p>SACHA\
    \ provides an implemented IIIF interface, allowing both human users and automated\
    \ computational tools to access the digitized materials. Source images are provided\
    \ via IIIFServer (IIPImage) and Loris Image Server, whereas metadata and full\
    \ text are displayed through the implementation of the IIIF Presentation API.\
    \ Users can access IIIF manifests, generated automatically from the library catalogue.\
    \ Furthermore, SACHA allows users to create IIIF collections dynamically via determined\
    \ identifiers (https://iiif.onb.ac.at/api#_unique_identifiers_of_digitized_objects)\
    \ or the result of a full text search (currently books only).</p><p>SACHA is also\
    \ a crucial technology at the ONB Labs (https://labs.onb.ac.at), the Austrian\
    \ National Library\u2019s library lab, launched in November 2018. Via the ONB\
    \ Labs website users can now create and save collections under the inclusion of\
    \ items from different data sets (digitized newspapers and postcards). They can\
    \ further share their collections publically and soon privately with individual\
    \ collaborators. These collections then serve as a basis for other applications\
    \ and tools provided by ONB Labs. In the near future, the creation of collections\
    \ will be refined to allow for page-based selections. Over the period of two years,\
    \ components to annotate user-generated collections based on IIIF and Open Annotations\
    \ will be implemented. These annotations will again be designed to be sharable\
    \ \u2013 both publically and privately \u2013 to further support collaborations\
    \ via the services of ONB Labs. A service already implemented in ONB Labs is the\
    \ provision of the Austrian National Library\u2019s Linked Open Dataset \u2013\
    \ as data dump and via SPARQL Lab \u2013 again including IIIF resources provided\
    \ by SACHA.</p><p>SACHA hosts instances of Mirador and Universal Viewer, allowing\
    \ to easily display manifests and collections. By providing both viewers, users\
    \ have the flexibility to base their selection on their specific research requirements.\
    \ On the ONB Labs website, SACHA is integrated via OpenSeadragon Viewer and will\
    \ in future iterations serve as a discovery interface, implemented via Elastic\
    \ Search.</p><p>The focus of the herein suggested talk will be to share the technological\
    \ aspects of the SACHA IIIF implementation, to present research opportunities\
    \ provided via IIIF and to gather feedback from the developer community, as well\
    \ as from researchers for current and future features.</p><p>The documentation\
    \ of the SACHA interface is available at \"https://iiif.onb.ac.at/api/\".</p><p>SACHA:\

- abstract: <p>The Abnormal Hieratic script was used in Egypt around the 7th century
    BCE, as a shorthand for hieroglyphs. Only a few people in the world currently
    understand this script well, but interest is growing. In current courses too little
    time is available to practice the alphabet in the classroom. More educational
    resources are needed to allow students to study the details of Abnormal Hieratic
    without depending on the experts directly.</p><p>In a joint pilot project between
    the Papyrological Institute, the Faculty of Humanities and the Centre for Digital
    Scholarship, an online portal is created to allow a community to grow around materials
    with Abnormal Hieratic text. It allows users to view Abnormal Hieratic sources
    in detail, online, with transcription and transliteration as previously published,
    and using metadata from Trismegistos, a platform with lots of information about
    texts from the ancient world. Words in the text will be linked to dictionaries,
    name books (for personal names) and gazetteers (for location names). The online
    portal and community helps pilot the strategic goal of the Faculty of Humanities
    to build and foster communities of interest around various types of sources.</p><p>The
    online portal is built around IIIF and the WordPress content management system.
    IIIF and annotations appear to be a perfect match for the requirements of viewing
    digitised papyri in detail and providing links between images, words and terms.
    WordPress and various plugins allowed us to version content and create custom
    APIs for working with annotations. The annotations are indexed in Elasticsearch
    to drive an interface in which the original text is shown next to an SVG rendering
    of the hieroglyphs, the Latin transliteration and the translation.</p><p>In this
    presentation we will present our architecture and data modeling choices. We will
    reflect on some issues we have or had to resolve, future goals and the use of
    this setup for building communities of interest around sources.</p>

    \ have been sharing these assets on Internet. Some institutions expose their digital\
    \ assets in foreign platforms, either international as Internet Archive or institutional\
    \ as Digital Libraries of Universities for instance. However, as in many other\
    \ countries and regions, the possibilities for use and reuse of this resources\
    \ are limited by technical, organizational, economical and legal reasons. The\
    \ limitations of infrastructure and the complexity to sustain open and interoperability\
    \ platforms have been a challenge for scale up national projects and integrate\
    \ those resources to the international ecology of cultural heritage resources.\
    \ In that context, Havana University, Infomed \u2013 The National Health Network,\
    \ The Cuban National Library Jos\xE9 Mart\xED and the Institute of Cuban History\
    \ made a joint effort to implement a first IIIF platform that was hosted and serviced\
    \ by Infomed. This was the first Cuban IIIF practical implementation and can be\
    \ visited at http://iiif.sld.cu/ . The group responsible for the creation of this\
    \ service in the form of a minimum viable product, contacted with the international\
    \ IIIF community and begin to participate, learn and implement different open\
    \ source products and to adapt that experience to the local needs. This group\
    \ also begin to promote IIIF in the country, presented the framework to different\
    \ communities and national projects related with Cuban cultural and historic heritage\
    \ and to the health community. As a result of the initiative, several institutions\
    \ and people are now connected with the framework in a practical way and new projects\
    \ are emerging as one with the main telecommunication company in the country.\
    \ The goal is to share a IIIF platform for several national initiatives and projects\
    \ serving the needs of different libraries and digital collections in the country\
    \ to lowering the friction cost to initiate new digital collections compatible\
    \ with the IIIF framework and to offer a solid base to the international integration\
    \ of Cuban digital resources globally and to promote national and international\
    \ cooperation and interoperability. </p>"

- abstract: "<p>Background</p><p>\u3000In recent years, the publication of images\
    \ using IIIF (International Image Interoperability Framework) has been proceeding\
    \ actively. This movement is also spreading to Japan, and the number of institutions\
    \ in Japan who publish IIIF images has been increasing. On the other hand, though\
    \ IIIF aims to collect and extract unified information as a mechanism, it is one\
    \ of the current challenges that there are few systems capable of unified search\
    \ and collection of IIIF images, especially in Japan. Therefore, in this research,\
    \ as a part of efforts to establish the foundation to utilize IIIF for humanities\
    \ research, we aim to develop the retrieval system across IIIF images published\
    \ by multiple institutions, especially Japanese institutions.</p><p>System development</p><p>\u3000\
    We use existing open source software and related modules. This is because it aims\
    \ to minimize proprietary development and customization, and to enhance the sustainability\
    \ of the system. Specifically, we use Omeka S which is an open source web publishing\
    \ platform and Apache Solr as a search engine.</p><p>\u3000We collect IIIF manifests\
    \ published by each institution. We target Japanese institutions that disclose\
    \ IIIF images as Open Data, such as The University of Tokyo, Kyoto University,\
    \ National Diet Library and National Institute of Japanese Literature. As a result\
    \ of crawling IIIF manifests published by each institution, more than 500,000\
    \ IIIF manifests were collected from 13 institutions. </p><p>\u3000Developed system\
    \ consists mainly of two functions, for searching and viewing IIIF images. In\
    \ the search function, the system provides facets to narrow down the search results.\
    \ As facets, \"Institution Name\" \"Database Name\" \"License\" are provided.\
    \ In the viewing function, IIIF images are displayed with Universal Viewer, which\
    \ is provided through the module of Omeka S. Also, metadata extracted from each\
    \ IIIF manifest is displayed at the same screen. Furthermore, the icon of IIIF\
    \ manifest of this item and the link to various IIIF compatible viewers such as\
    \ Mirador and Leaflet are displayed.</p><p>Use case</p><p>\u3000In order to confirm\
    \ the usefulness of the developed system, we verify whether it can be searched\
    \ across IIIF images held by multiple institutions. In this case study, we target\
    \ the picture scrolls \"Night Parade of One Hundred Demons\". In Japan, National\
    \ Diet Library, National Institute of Japanese Literature, and the University\
    \ of Tokyo publish the scrolls as IIIF images. As a result of searching \"Night\
    \ Parade of One Hundred Demons\" in this system and sorting in descending order\
    \ of relevance, we were able to get all of the collections of the 3 institutions\
    \ in the top 6 search results. Although this is a simple function verification,\
    \ we confirmed that it is possible to retrieve IIIF images published by multiple\
    \ institutions. This system is expected to function as a discovery service in\
    \ humanities research.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>\u3000In this research, we developed\
    \ a retrieval system across more than 500,000 IIIF items released by 13 institutions\
    \ in Japan. This system also helps to contribute to widely disseminating Japanese\
    \ resources to the world.</p>"

    \ the contents of \"Kunshujo\", which is a collection of over 100 scrapbooks (https://iiif.dl.itc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/repo/s/tanaka/document/d230f1f8-5929-4138-bb28-1108d77fd32a).\
    \ Various materials such as pamphlets and product labels from the late Edo period\
    \ to the Taisho era (from 1603 to 1926) collected by Yoshio Tanaka, who was a\
    \ naturalist in the Meiji Era, are pasted on the pages. The library of The University\
    \ of Tokyo released these IIIF images in book units in August 2018. However, it\
    \ was desired to search in pasted material units on the pages. In order to solve\
    \ this problem, we developed a system that can search over 35,000 pasted materials\
    \ using IIIF annotation.</p><p>\u3000For this annotation process, we used two\
    \ methods; manual annotation with Omeka IIIF Toolkit and automatic annotation\
    \ with Deep Learning. The following describes each annotation method and the search\
    \ system based on them.</p><p> </p><p>Manual annotation with Omeka and IIIF Toolkit</p><p>\u3000\
    We developed an environment that allows multiple users to annotate online using\
    \ Omeka and IIIF Toolkit plugin. 15 books were targeted, and 2,713 pasted materials\
    \ on 826 pages were annotated by 6 collaborators. Also, since other organization\
    \ in The University of Tokyo has released catalog data (titles, dates, place names,\
    \ etc.) of those annotated materials, we associated images with those catalog\
    \ data. Specifically, we converted the annotation data into data conforming to\
    \ IIIF Curation API defined by CODH (Center for Open Data in the Humanities) and\
    \ described the catalog data as metadata of each curation data.</p><p>\u3000Using\
    \ these annotated data, we developed a system that searches pasted materials together\
    \ with catalog data using IIIF Curation Platform developed by CODH (https://kunshujo.dl.itc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/table.html).\
    \ This system also provides the functions to browse IIIF images on maps and chronologies.\
    \ This system is characterized by using various resources (IIIF, open data, and\
    \ open source software) provided by multiple institutions.</p><p> </p><p>Automatic\
    \ annotation with Deep Learning</p><p>\u3000We used the object detection algorithm\
    \ YOLO v3 for automatic annotation. For the learning process, the manual annotations\
    \ mentioned above were used for fine tuning. As a result, 34,746 pasted materials\
    \ (annotations) on 13,069 pages from 99 books were automatically extracted. These\
    \ annotations were also converted into data conforming to IIIF Curation API.</p><p>\u3000\
    Using these extracted materials, we developed a similar image retrieval system\
    \ (http://kunshujo-i.dl.itc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/#/search?index=11854). The reason for\
    \ using image information is that the catalog data of these materials has not\
    \ been created yet. We used 2,048 dimensional feature vectors extracted using\
    \ the inception-v3 model, and cosine similarity was used to calculate image similarity.\
    \ This system enables to extract similar or same pasted materials used in different\
    \ books and pages.</p><p> </p><p>Conclusion</p><p>\u3000We described a case based\
    \ on hybrid annotations by humans and computer. We confirmed that IIIF contributes\
    \ to reduce the cost for creating training data of machine learning and developing\
    \ applications.</p>"

- abstract: "<p>Though we continue to work towards interoperability as a community,\
    \ IIIF took root at individual institutions, each digitising their own content,\
    \ and creating manifests that mirrored their physical collections. However, as\
    \ more and more material has become IIIF compatible, it is now possible to do\
    \ more than simply create a digital surrogate of a physical item. This paper seeks\
    \ to examine this possibility using the collection of Matthew Parker, a sixteenth-century\
    \ Archbishop of Canterbury who is famous for breaking apart manuscripts in order\
    \ to \u2018make\u2019 new compilations of material. Using two case studies of\
    \ these \u2018reconstructed books\u2019 -- the first a combination of two manuscripts\
    \ from the Parker Library of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge and the British\
    \ Library, the second an attempt to reconstruct a pair of codices that were famously\
    \ scrambled by Matthew Parker, now held at the Parker Library and the Cambridge\
    \ University Library -- this paper seeks to move beyond the objects themselves.\
    \ It will question not only the rationale behind the assembly of composite digital\
    \ surrogates but also will seek to address the technical questions that arise\
    \ when no single repository can be responsible for the digital object. Though\
    \ the technical compilation of multi-repository manifests can be easily done via\
    \ the Bodleian\u2019s IIIF Manifest Editor, who owns these objects? Who is responsible\
    \ for their preservation? Are digitally composite manuscripts, by their very nature,\
    \ a new class of ephemera? And what would happen should one of the participating\
    \ institutions fall out of the IIIF universe? Though this paper does not pretend\
    \ to have the answers to these questions, it aims to move the community to think\

    in the world of AV, thanks to the time parameter on the canvas. A lot of thought
    goes on around our collections content as to how to tell an item's story, and
    how we contextualise our collections online. Up till now, we have made our images
    and associated metadata available in manifests attached to a museums record, with
    the intention of allowing people to take those images and any underlying metadata
    with them to another viewer, but without any additional "clues".</p><p>With IIIF
    AV, we are able to show these items in context with their corresponding video,
    audio and description to improve the user's holistic understanding of the item,
    beyond what a 2-dimensional can do. We can work this out programmatically, and
    thus generate a standardised "AV powerpoint" to accompany each item.</p><p>Needless
    to say, there's plenty more you can do if you're NOT operating programmatically.
    If you have the time to build a CSV with all your co-ordinates, sizes, somewhere
    to put your media and a Python script to turn it into a manifest, you can have
    a lot of fun with it. To describe Scotland's crucial match with Holland at the
    1978 World Cup is not something you would perhaps expect to see in IIIF, but IIIF
    has never been restrictive on what it's used for!</p><p>I will talk about the
    questions that arise from doing this work:</p><p>-How useful is this? </p><p>-Are
    there better media to do the same job? </p><p>-Where could it lead?</p><p>This
    talk owes a large debt to Tom Crane's "Fire" of course.</p>

    \ manuscripts could find them just like that \u2013 in one good catalogue and\
    \ most or all of them digitized. Imagine them having easy, direct and open access\
    \ to the earliest sources of European culture. Imagine them creating new critical\
    \ editions and learning more from the texts in the most original form we possess\
    \ them.</p><p>Some hundred years ago, only some specialized scholars worked on\
    \ ancient manuscripts. Such a specialist took the train from Berlin to study a\
    \ manuscript in Rome. In the last decades of the 20th century, he took a plane.\
    \ The digitization of the manuscripts has changed the situation completely. Now\
    \ all potentially interested scholars, teachers and students, thanks to Gallica,\
    \ Manuscripta medievalia, DigiVatLib and other great and small websites, have\
    \ access to incredible amount of digitized manuscripts. </p><p>In the long run,\
    \ this will have a huge impact on creation of critical editions of ancient texts.\
    \ For example, in 1904 Franz Weihrich published the latest critical edition of\
    \ Augustine\u2019s De consensus evangelistarum. As a backbone of his edition,\
    \ he used 20 early manuscripts from 6th to 11th centuries. However, there are\
    \ 24 early manuscripts that Weihrich was not able use for his critical edition,\
    \ and 12 of these have been digitized. Nowadays it is possible for an interested\
    \ scholar, or even layperson, to find digitized manuscripts that have not been\
    \ mentioned in critical editions of classical texts.</p><p>Can we make the long\
    \ run shorter? Can we bring together all the digitized manuscripts in one place\
    \ where they could be used in various ways: creating new editions on ancient texts,\
    \ discussing questions of their interpretation, finding out how to use them for\
    \ teaching purposes, and so on?</p><p>Yes, we can. We have all the elements needed\
    \ to build a Digital Manuscript Wonderland (DMW). It would be a virtual research\
    \ and learning environment, where several stakeholder groups (researchers, teachers,\
    \ students, journalists, all citizens) can reuse digitized manuscripts in various\
    \ ways. As mentioned we already have lots of manuscripts digitized and digitizing\
    \ continues. DMW could give a platform for digitize on demand service to bring\
    \ out need for materials not digitized yet. To enhance interoperability and reusability\
    \ we need FAIR metadata and DMW could have tools for evaluating metadata. Other\
    \ DMW services might be edition making, making and sharing of teaching material,\
    \ TDM services and linked open data services.</p><p>Although all the needed technical\
    \ components already exist, unfortunately implementation is not straightforward.\
    \ Moreover, more important than technical implementation is the human network,\
    \ getting together dreamers and makers of DMW, in the spirit of African proverb:\
    \ \u201CIf you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together\u201D\

- abstract: '<p>It is important for libraries and museums to understand how digital
    collections and their contents have been used for many reasons, e.g., accountability
    for stakeholders. In these years, a lot of libraries and museums have adopted
    IIIF. In IIIF-compatible digital collections, an image is fetched via IIIF Image
    API. Every time the image is zoomed and panned on an image viewer, the image is
    called via IIIF Image APIs with varying the value of the region. Thus, it is possible
    to investigate the detailed image usage by examining which regions of images have
    been requested. In our presentation, we show a method to analyze the image usage
    and to visualize the analysis result. The method is comprised of the two steps:
    1) measure the number of accesses to each pixel and 2) generate heat map in which
    the color of each pixel represents the number of accesses to the corresponding
    pixel. Since a pixel is the smallest unit that composes an image, we enable a
    fine-grained analysis. Heat maps visualize which regions of an image get more
    and less accesses. The generated heat maps are displayed over the corresponding
    target images using the layer function of Mirador. As a result of the analysis,
    we observe the tendency that the regions close to the center get more accesses
    than other regions. One of the reasons is that the regions close to the center
    have higher probabilities to be accessed, when users zoom and pan an image on
    an image viewer. Therefore, we theoretically compute the probability to be accessed
    for each pixel and examine how to adjust the number of accesses to each pixel
    depending on the position of the pixels. In the presentation, we discuss adjustment
    methods that use the computed probabilities. Finally, we present possible applications
    including collaborative research platform and transcription platform. </p>'

- abstract: '<p>Researchers wanting to perform digital text analysis first need access
    to texts. While this is relatively straightforward for researchers working on
    born-digital text, researchers working on historical text need to go through a
    few steps before they can start with the text analysis itself (for example, topic
    modelling or social network analysis). Key steps in this process are finding,
    collecting, and combining relevant data from a variety of digital resources, enriching
    the resources with annotations, and extracting the full text from those resources.
    It is important that the link between the extracted text and the original is maintained,
    ideally on a line, word or even character level, to allow researchers to easily
    move from a ''distant reading'' to a ''close reading'' perspective. </p><p>Many
    textual resources already exist in image form (scans and pictures from manuscripts,
    for example). The strength of IIIF lies in that it allows for those images to
    easily be exchanged and combined from different locations. As part of the Flemish
    participation in DARIAH (Digital Research Infrastructure for the Arts and Humanities)
    and CLARIN (Common Language Resources and Technology Infrastructure), the Ghent
    Centre for Digital Humanities supported the development of Madoc by Digirati.
    Madoc is an Omeka S based platform for the display, enrichment, and curation of
    IIIF-based digital objects. It allows for the import and presentation of IIIF
    manifests as well as crowd-sourced image annotations. It is a first key step in
    the process towards a platform that will allow researchers to collect and curate
    resources and extract the text layer for further analysis. What is still missing
    is that second step. </p><p>In a next phase, our goal is therefore to extract
    the text layer from the ingested images, either automatically through integration
    with Optical Character Recognition (OCR) software, or manually by adding transcription
    functionalities that are more user-friendly than the current transcription options
    and that maintain the direct link between words and sentences and their location
    on the image. The idea is to build on the image-centred focus of IIIF but to expand
    it towards textual data. A further envisioned enhancement to the platform is an
    integrated search (allowing researchers to search metadata, annotations, and full
    text simultaneously). </p><p>We are currently conducting a market study for the
    next phase of development, which should take place in the upcoming months. During
    the IIIF conference, we would like to present the Madoc platform (and any additional
    developments that will have taken place by then) from a researcher''s perspective
    during a lightning talk: how can it help a researcher go from data collections
    in libraries to digital text analysis? What are some of the current bottlenecks
    related to the integration of IIIF and text? </p>'

    \ scholarly geographic annotation, i.e. the transcription, marking up and geo-resolving\
    \ of maps and geographical texts such as itineraries and travel reports, in the\
    \ context of historical scholarship (e.g. to map or extract data from a specific\
    \ document, or to prepare a digital edition). More recently, however, we have\
    \ been expanding the feature set significantly in order to provide more general\
    \ annotation functionality. Through an easy-to-use interface, users can: navigate\
    \ digitized documents; create personal collections; add comments; tag (and build\
    \ up tagging vocabularies); transcribe toponyms and geo-resolve them by linking\
    \ to gazetteers. Users can either work alone in a closed workspace, together as\
    \ groups of collaborators on shared documents, or in a public setting, using Recogito\
    \ as a crowdsourcing platform. Recogito keeps track of version history and edit\
    \ provenance, can be customized with different gazetteers for geo-resolution,\
    \ and supports a range of import and export formats. Most importantly, Recogito\
    \ supports import of images by means of IIIF collection manifests, as well as\
    \ import of text in TEI format. Export formats are available to support a variety\
    \ of user needs and scenarios, and include CSV, GeoJSON, TEI and W3C Web Annotation.</p><p>In\
    \ this talk, we will first present an overview of Recogito\u2019s feature set\
    \ and user interface. We will then outline some scenarios for how annotation offers\
    \ opportunities for archives and libraries who are publishing their collections\
    \ through IIIF to engage new audiences, aid scholarly research, and leverage the\
    \ community to harvest new and more fine-grained metadata about their holdings\
    \ - including metadata that creates links beyond the confines of the institutional\
    \ catalogue. We will present examples for how Recogito has been used previously,\
    \ and provide an outlook on Recogito\u2019s further development roadmap, which\
    \ is presently supported financially through the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.\
    \ Last but not least, we will discuss issues of interoperability and tool pipelines:\
    \ i.e. possible technical approaches through which institutions and libraries\
    \ can make use of Recogito for their own collections in different ways; and for\
    \ how Recogito can be beneficially used in conjunction with other platforms, such\
    \ as e.g. transcription tools or machine learning environments. </p><p>Additional\
    \ information about Recogito is available at our source code repository http://github.com/pelagios/recogito2.\

- abstract: <p>Georeferencing images has been commonplace in our communities for many
    years, from before we fully embraced the web. The IIIF Image API has, for a long
    time, described in the annex a GeoJSON service. Commercial services exist which
    consume and display images using the IIIF API, but they do not make use of this
    service. So what practical steps can implementers and consumers take to expose
    and make use of this data, and how can we link it to the pixels? In this presentation,
    I will give an overview of the problem domain, the technical hurdles to overcome,
    and some demonstrations of what I think is the right direction (pun intended)</p>

- abstract: "<p>We present the \u201CIIIF Curation Platform\u201D (ICP) [1] that we\
    \ officially released in November 2018. The ICP was built upon the idea of user-driven\
    \ image sharing called curation. Unlike provider-driven image sharing, which is\
    \ typical among GLAM organizations for publishing their properties to the public,\
    \ user-driven image sharing is for scholars and citizens who want to build their\
    \ own virtual collections and add metadata of their own. There are no straightforward\
    \ methods to realize this functionality within the current IIIF specifications\
    \ because this usage is considered out of their scope. </p><p>To support the workflow\
    \ of user-driven image sharing, the ICP offers seven open source components in\
    \ two categories. The first category includes client-side tools for browsing and\
    \ managing IIIF curations, namely 1) IIIF Curation Viewer (and its embedded version),\
    \ 2) IIIF Curation Manager, 3) IIIF Curation Editor, 4) IIIF Curation Finder,\
    \ and 5) IIIF Curation Player. The second category includes server-side tools\
    \ for storing and serving IIIF curations, namely 1) JSONkeeper, and 2) Canvas\
    \ Indexer. Those tools are designed to follow the pattern of modular design and\
    \ microservices, including Docker installation, and are built with interoperability\
    \ in mind, including synchronization between JSONkeeper and Canvas Indexer implemented\
    \ using the preliminary version of the IIIF Change Discovery API.</p><p>We applied\
    \ the ICP to several applications, such as the Collection of Facial Expressions\
    \ [2], Bukan Complete Collection [3], North China Railway Archive [4], and a museum\
    \ exhibition at The Museum of Art, Kochi Prefecture, each implemented by a different\
    \ combination of ICP components. Open source license, together with instruction\
    \ for easier installation and operation, helps increase the adoption of the ICP,\
    \ such as the University of Tokyo [5]. </p><p>Finally, we show how we use the\
    \ ICP with machine learning for image annotation. The current usage of machine\
    \ learning is two-fold. First, automatic image tagging was used for the Collection\
    \ of Facial Expressions. On Canvas Indexer, we developed an API for a machine\
    \ learning service (image tagging) so that Canvas Indexer requests the service\
    \ to annotate fragments of images by machine generated tags and return them for\
    \ tag-based search at Canvas Indexer. Second, automatic image colorization was\
    \ used for the North China Railway Archive. On IIIF Curation Viewer, we added\
    \ a choice between an original gray-scale photograph and a colorized photograph,\
    \ using the Choice of Alternative Resources (oa:Choice) defined in IIIF Presentation\
    \ API 2.1. This approach allows us to create a natural representation of a photograph\
    \ with multiple expressions, namely one manifest with two resources, the original\
    \ photograph and the colorized photograph, on the same canvas so that we can switch\
    \ between them on the same coordinate system. </p><p>Future work includes an authentication\
    \ and authorization mechanism to manage IIIF sources which are closed or semi-closed.\

    APIs for the exchange of digital images and metadata between the two systems.
    By focusing on tangible user needs, we were able to prototype immediate solutions
    and ultimately make them production-ready. The re-usability of the IIIF APIs meant
    that those initial technical efforts were quickly rewarded when applied to later

- abstract: <p>The capabilities of IIIF to crop images, annotate parts, and link to
    text and metadata resources have the potential to turn this framework into a major
    player in the field of digital editions. In particular, this holds true with regard
    to text-image-synopsis, as some IIIF viewers feature the annotation layer to connect
    image and text. </p><p>The Virtual Research Environment (VRE) TextGrid provides
    an increasing compatibility with the aforementioned IIIF features. The most recent
    step in this context is the integration of an IIIF viewer into its client, the
    TextGrid Laboratory (an RCP-based editor for preparing Digital Editions). This
    allows the native format of TextGrid for text-image-link files (that was established
    before IIIF started) to be displayed in this viewer via the annotation layer or
    as a set of canvases containing crops made with the editor (https://textgrid.de/tools-services-ressourcen).</p><p>TextGrid
    has the built-in capability to create IIIF manifests by converting *published*
    TEI or METS/MODS resources since 2013. In addition to the conversion of content
    from specific TEI resources to the IIIF annotation layer (https://mathias-goebel.github.io/2017-06-IIIF/)
    and the publication of IIIF manifests in the TextGrid Repository, we now also
    offer IIIF viewing functionalities within the client software. This prototype
    is able to generate IIIF manifests on the fly based on the order and hierarchy
    of objects in a navigational tool of the client that supports drag-and-drop. As
    such, it provides a preview of *unpublished* data that are stored in a private
    part of the repository. It allows for the presentation of a selected collection
    (TEI/XML or METS/MODS files, including the text-image-links) either via the annotation
    layer or by adding the cropped selections as items to the canvases. </p><p>This
    feature lets users preview the IIIF manifests and their presentation in an IIIF
    viewer *before* publishing the data. It is a valuable addition to the TextGrid
    Lab workspace, as it makes major benefits of IIIF available not only during publishing,
    but already during the preparation of Digital Editions.</p>

    \ for the first Digital Humanities Summer School at the Center for Manuscript\
    \ Genetics, University of Antwerp. While we touched on important IIIF features\
    \ such as manifests, image viewers and image annotation, the focus of the workshop\
    \ centered on an aspect of image interoperability that is often reserved for technicians:\
    \ setting up the IIIF compliant image server. Applying the didactic concept of\
    \ experiential learning, we taught our students more about image interoperability\
    \ from the perspective of its physical backbone. Guided by an interactive tutorial,\
    \ we built a network of fifteen IIPImage servers on as many Raspberry Pis. Once\
    \ installed and running, we used these servers to distribute digital facsimiles\
    \ from the draft manuscript of Mary Shelley\u2019s Frankenstein recently released\
    \ in IIIF by the Bodleian Digital Library.</p><p>The students were divided into\
    \ small groups. In a first team effort the Raspberry Pi network was set up with\
    \ the aid of a gigabit router and further networking hardware. Each team then\
    \ installed and configured their own device into a locally accessible IIPImage\
    \ server. For the purpose of this workshop, each team represented a fictional\
    \ cultural heritage institute that held the rights for three high resolution images\
    \ of the Frankenstein collection. Only by transforming their images into Pyramid\
    \ TIFFs, distributing them via their own image server, and collecting the images\
    \ of other teams in self-written manifests, could \u201Cthe monster\u201D (i.e.:\
    \ the entire collection) be assembled. Finally, all the teams\u2019 manifests\
    \ were loaded in a local Mirador Viewer instance on another Raspberry Pi. Guided\
    \ by the tutors, every step of the workshop \u2013 from the initial setup and\
    \ the image server configuration to the compilation and publication of their manifests\

    \ of opportunities to make mistakes and collaborate in order to fix them. The\

    \ course throughout the two and a half day period by incorporating the students\u2019\
    \ input and fixing bugs as we went along. </p><p>In this paper we want to focus\
    \ on our evaluation of the student feedback, and on the process of refining the\
    \ developed concept for a second, updated version of the workshop. Following the\
    \ \u201Clearning by doing\u201D approach, computer skills that had been condensed\
    \ into theoretical introductory sessions will now be embedded directly into hands-on\
    \ exercises in the course. Additionally, we want to extend the workshop and address\
    \ the specific needs of digital scholarly editors and digital archives to process\
    \ and publish images via IIIF. Finally, we will introduce a publicly available\
    \ tutorial of the workshop that enables other lecturers to reproduce the workshop\
    \ and adapt it to their needs, and look to a future where the workshop may be\
    \ taught at different institutions simultaneously \u2013 thus making IIIF\u2019\
    s vision for \u2018International Image Interoperability\u2019 even more tangible\
    \ for the lecturers and students who utilize it.</p>"

- abstract: "<p>The Macbeth Story website, built collaboratively by a cross-institutional\
    \ team from the V&A, AusStage, NUI-Galway, and the Folger Shakespeare Library,\
    \ brings together IIIF-compliant images of artifacts from these institutions to\
    \ tell a unique story of Macbeth performances in Australia, Ireland, England,\
    \ and the United States. These images will be shown alongside their related metadata\
    \ and associated annotations in a IIIF slideshow viewer originally developed by\
    \ the V&A and in a IIIF single-item viewer originally developed by the Folger.\
    \ IIIF standards and tools have given us the technological infrastructure that\
    \ enable us to easily, automatically, and consistently combine these resources\
    \ in one WordPress website, broadening the reach of our collections and connecting\
    \ our resources in a way that has never been done before. </p><p>This experimental\
    \ website will be built on a customized WordPress environment connected to the\
    \ Folger\u2019s new home for digital collections online: the Miranda digital asset\
    \ platform. Miranda\u2019s UV-based viewer will pull digitized images and their\
    \ metadata directly from Miranda via IIIF and GraphQL queries. The site will also\
    \ look to present images and annotations in a selection of viewers built on top\
    \ of the CanvasPanel library (a React-based component built for the V&A) such\
    \ as Slideshows, Annotated Image, and Image Tours. Each of these viewing experiences\
    \ has been developed as open source components by the Folger & the V&A, with code\
    \ available for re-use and extension by other institutions. </p><p>This IIIF viewer\
    \ exchange has immediate implications beyond the Macbeth Story website: once the\
    \ slideshow viewer has been re-packaged into a WordPress plugin format, the Folger\
    \ will be able to investigate using it on other WordPress blogs to showcase series\
    \ of related items. In addition, the V&A is investigating how the Miranda UV-based\
    \ viewer can be implemented on their WordPress blog, which currently doesn't have\
    \ any IIIF capability, unlike the rest of the V&A website.</p><p>In this talk,\
    \ we will begin by showcasing the Macbeth Story website and the tools that we\
    \ have created, highlighting how IIIF viewers are helping us to reach broader,\
    \ cross-institutional audiences. Then we will go into the technical process of\
    \ evaluating and reworking the code for each viewer, where it needs to be integrated\
    \ by the receiving institution. We will share the discoveries and challenges (not\
    \ the least of which are the time zone differences) that have emerged throughout\
    \ the project, to aid others embarking on similar partnerships. For example, we\u2019\
    ll share advice on how to make code available for others to use while ensuring\
    \ that it works optimally for the originating institution, which can be a complex\
    \ conflicting goal. Finally, we will share our next steps for these IIIF resources\
    \ and viewers.</p>"

- abstract: "<p>With the abundance of image material available in archives and digital\
    \ libraries, accurate and useful metadata has proven critical for search and browse\
    \ operations. With the scale of images UCLA is ingesting into our IIIF environment,\
    \ traditional image level metadata attached by catalogers can be time consuming.\
    \ UCLA is building a proof of concept automated metadata tagging pipeline using\
    \ off the shelf machine learning models with a future possibility of plugging\
    \ in domain specific relevant models.</p><p>This talk will outline UCLA\u2019\
    s experience with integrating IIIF assets into an automated pipeline workflow,\
    \ using a message queue, cloud ML/AI image services, an annotation storage server,\
    \ and a search engine. We will also present an analysis of the validity and usefulness\
    \ of several cloud Computer Vision models for tagging and improving the relevancy\
    \ of search results.</p><p>For this experiment, we have opted for a tool set that\
    \ is simple to get up and running quickly, with as little customization as possible.\
    \ We use open source systems for the primary components, including Cantaloupe\
    \ as the IIIF image server, Elucidate for Annotations storage, and Blacklight\
    \ & Solr for the search engine and user interface. For image tagging, we use the\
    \ free cloud services available from Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Clarafai.\
    \ To orchestrate the pipeline we use the Python package Celery with RabbitMQ.</p><p>The\
    \ pipeline workflow consists of harvesting images via IIIF protocols, running\
    \ the images through multiple image tagging services, storing those tags using\
    \ the Web Annotations data model and protocols, and then using those annotations\
    \ to augment the item metadata in the search engine. We will then analyze the\
    \ change in search results to determine which, if any, of the tagging services\
    \ improved relevancy ranking, and if so, by how much.</p><p>The goals of the experiment\
    \ are to expose our team to the Web Annotations protocol and learn what would\
    \ be required to integrate IIIF and Web Annotations in an automated production\
    \ pipeline. We have mixed expectations regarding the usefulness of the commercial\
    \ image tagging services. The metadata produced by such services may be too generic\
    \ for scholars using a digital library, but may be helpful for users from the\
    \ general public. The experiment will help us identify weaknesses in the commercial\
    \ services and surface areas of opportunity in training our own models.</p>"

- abstract: <p>In this lightning talk we would like to introduce our approach in aggregating
    the content of various european content providers into a universal player using
    IIIF Manifests as a standard. Europeana Media, Noterik, and the Netherlands Institute
    for Sound and Vision are collaborating in order to provide users with a universal
    player for Europeana, through which they can access audiovisual content from across
    multiple archives. The player will provide functionality in line with what researchers
    requested (e.g. annotations, transcripts, searching, and sharing). Audiovisual
    content as well as annotations are exchanged in the form of IIIF manifests. By
    releasing the source code for the Europeana universal player, we want to enable
    others in the community to reuse and add to the work that has been done within
    the scope of the project. We will present the architecture we have used to achieve
    this, and discuss the challenges in working with a standard such as IIIF manifests
    when dealing with multiple content providers. </p>

- abstract: '<p>Digital Mappa (DM for short) is a freely available online environment
    for creating projects out of digital images and texts. The premise of DM is simple
    and powerful: if you have a collection of digital images and/or texts, you should
    be able to produce an online resource that links together specific moments on
    these images and texts together, annotate these moments as much as you want, collaborate
    with others on this work, have the content you produce be searchable, and publish
    this work to others or the public as you wish. And you should be able to do this
    with little technical expertise. </p><p>DM 2.0 is the latest version, rewritten
    to take advantage of new UX technologies and IIIF. With DM 2.0, users can drag
    and drop a manifest into a project and instantly populate it with images from
    around the world. This makes it easy to bring together material from a wide range
    of sources, annotate them extensively, and then publish an exhibit to the web.</p>'
