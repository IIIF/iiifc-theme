  blurb:
  - >
    High-performance dynamic image server in Java
  - >
    Cantaloupe is an open-source image server enabling on-demand generation of derivatives of high-resolution source images.
    With available operations including cropping, scaling, and rotation, it can support deep-zooming image viewers,
    as well as on-the-fly thumbnail generation. Project goals include performance, scalability, and extensibility, without sacrificing ease-of-use.
  - >
    Cantaloupe supports the IIIF Image API version 1 & 2.
- name: IIPImage Server

  blurb:
  - >
    The IIPImage server is a high performance image server for streaming high
    resolution images. It supports advanced image features such as 16 and 32
    bit color depths, floating point data, CIELAB colorimetric images and
    scientific imagery such as multispectral or hyperspectral images.
  - >
    The server  is an Fast CGI module written in C++ that is designed to be
    embedded within a host web server such as Apache, Lighttpd, MyServer or Nginx.

- name: Rodent-Assimilated Image Server (RAIS)
  uri: https://github.com/uoregon-libraries/rais-image-server
  blurb:
  - >
    RAIS is a high-performance IIIF Image server written in Go aimed primarily
    at handling JP2 images.  It has direct integration with openjpeg, making
    its JP2 decoding extremely fast. It has an optional plugin which can be
    used to add ImageMagick bindings for fast decoding of non-JP2 sources. It
    can optionally cache tiles to memory using an intelligent 2Q LRU cache.
  - >
    Plugins are supported to allow operations like pulling from S3 on demand and 
    adding arbitrary middleware.
  - >
    RAIS supports level 2 of the IIIF Image API 2.1 as well as some optional features like max image size.

- name: Djatoka
  uri: https://sourceforge.net/projects/djatoka/
  blurb:
  - >
    Djatoka is an open source, Java-based image server that provides
    compression and region extraction of JPEG 2000 images, URI-addressability
    of regions, and support for multiple image formats (including., BMP, GIF,
    JPG, PNG, PNM, TIF, JPEG 2000). Djatoka comes with a plug-in framework that
    allows transformations to be applied to regions and resolutions (e.g.,
    watermarking).
  - >
    Djatoka is not natively IIIF-compatible. However, djatoka URI’s are easily
    translated to IIIF URI’s (for example see this
    [Ruby on Rails gem](https://github.com/jronallo/djatoka) that does the
    translation).

  blurb:
  - >
    This is a fork of @greut's iiif package that moves all of the processing logic for the IIIF Image API in to discrete Go packages and defines source, derivative and graphics details in a JSON config file. There is an additional caching layer for both source images and derivatives. [https://go-iiif.github.io/go-iiif/](https://go-iiif.github.io/go-iiif/)
