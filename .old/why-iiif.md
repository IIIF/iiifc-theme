# Why IIIF?

For institutions, IIIF enables better, faster and cheaper image delivery, while reducing long term maintenance and technological lock in.

For end users, IIIF offers a rich set of functionality for viewing & zooming, and allows for the assembly of the best mix of resources and tools to view, compare, manipulate and work with images on the Web all of which is portable--shareable, citable, embeddable. 

To see how IIIF serves other institutions and end users, check out the [Showcase]({{ page.webprefix }}/showcase) section of this site, and don't miss the [IIIF Awesome list][awesome]{:.external} for lots of links to tools, demos, tutorials, and other resources.

### Rich Image Delivery

Fast, rich zoom & pan delivery of images via the Internet, with options for size, scale, region of interest, rotation, quality and format. 


### Plug and Play Software

Use any IIIF-compatible software for viewing, comparing and manipulating images from any IIIF-compatible image site, regardless of the back-end server. Swap parts of the stack at any time, or run multiple components in parallel at once. 


### Publish Once, Reuse Often

Deliver images from your own site for many uses; host a single copy and embed in other sites. No need to transfer images to others for them to locally load and use them for one off analysis or republishing. 


### Remix Content

Assemble and use image-based resources from across the Web, regardless of source. Compare pages, build an exhibit, or view a virtual collection of items served from different sites. 


### Annotation

IIIF has native compatibility with the [W3C Web Annotation model][wadm], which supports annotating content on the Web. Comment on, transcribe, and mark up resources using the Web’s inherent architecture. 


### Cite and Share

IIIF APIs give portable views onto images or any of its regions, and provide incentive for URIs that persist through image server migrations. Cite an image with a stable URI, or share it for reference by others--or yourself in a different environment. 


### Support for Attribution and Access Control

Built in API calls support attribution and access control. A work in progress, the newly published Authentication API ([http://iiif.io/api/auth/0.9/](http://iiif.io/api/auth/0.9/)), is integral and consistent with the IIIF conception.


### Global Network

Join a global network of image suppliers making content available in a common framework. Tap a growing suite of software tools and platforms. Maximize the use of your images on the Web. Unlock new potential with interoperability. Bring together content from multiple sources (organizational and technical)
