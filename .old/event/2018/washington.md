The 2018 International Image Interoperability Framework ([IIIF][home-page]) Conference will be held May 21-25 in Washington, DC, co-hosted by the Library of Congress, the Smithsonian Institution, and the Folger Shakespeare Library.

## What is IIIF?
Embraced by a growing number of the worldâ€™s leading research and cultural heritage organizations, IIIF provides an open framework for organizations to publish their image-based resources, to be viewed, cited, annotated and compared by any compatible image-viewing application.

## Who is it for?
This event will be valuable for cultural heritage, STEM institutions, repository and collection managers, software engineers; or for anyone engaged with image-based and soon A/V resources on the Web. If you have not been involved with IIIF in the past this is an opportunity to quickly get up to speed and understand the community and its benefits.

## What will I learn?
 * How to adopt IIIF at your institution
 * Leveraging open source software to get more out of your collection of images and video
 * Use cases and best practices from IIIF adopters
