## Accommodation in Edinburgh
There are many places to stay in Edinburgh – we recommend using the search engines below for the best rates. We will be located to the south of the city centre, the location will often be described as ‘Old Town’ (the postcode for Tuesday-Thursday is EH1 1LZ). Princes Street is the main shopping street – it has a number of hotels but is likely to be quite noisy. Cowgate is also a noisy location near a number of bars.

General booking sites:
 * [https://www.booking.com](https://www.booking.com)
 * https://www.trivago.co.uk
 * Hotel review site: [https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/)
 * University Accommodation: [https://www.edinburghfirst.co.uk/](https://www.edinburghfirst.co.uk/)

## Weather in Edinburgh in December
December in Edinburgh means long nights as it will be getting dark early, about 4:00pm, the average maximum and minimum temperatures in December are 7C and 1C, there is a possibility of rain. https://www.holiday-weather.com/edinburgh/averages/ . Pack layers and a raincoat, umbrellas are recommended although Edinburgh is a windy city, it is likely to be frosty in the mornings, but snow in December is rare. Hats, scarves and gloves can easily be purchased in Edinburgh if needed.

## Travel to Edinburgh

 * **Edinburgh Airport**. Flights to Edinburgh arrive into [Edinburgh Airport][ed-airport] (EDI). More information is available on [flights to Edinburgh][eds-flights]. To get from the airport to the city centre it is possible to take either a bus or a tram.
   * **Airport Bus**. The [Airlink 100][airlink] bus service runs between the airport and the city centre and takes approximately 30 minutes. Tickets cost £4.50 for an adult single, or £7.50 for an airport return, and can be bought at the airport information desk, at the bus stop, from the driver or online. [Airport Buses – Lothian Buses][lothian-airport] also offer connections to and from the airport on bus lines N22, 200, 300. For information on bus services in and around Edinburgh, please visit [Lothian Buses][lothian-bus].
   * **Airport Tram**. Trams run frequently from Edinburgh Airport to York place, running through the city centre en-route. For more information please [click here][tram].  
 * **Travel by Train**. If travelling from within the UK, Edinburgh is easily accessed by the [national rail service][nrs] arriving into either Haymarket Station or [Edinburgh Waverley Station][waverley], which is the closest to the University.
 * **Travel by Car**. Travel times by road are less than you might think. From the south: Birmingham is about 5 hours away; Manchester and York, 3 hours; Newcastle, 2 hours. From the north: Inverness is about 3 hours away; Aberdeen, 2 hours.

## Travel in Edinburgh
All venues are in walking distance of one another and time will be allowed for travel between locations. Black taxis can be hailed on the road, mini-cabs and Ubers need to be booked. If exploring Edinburgh, or staying further out of town, the bus network is excellent. Lothian Buses are operated by the Council and you can use the app to buy tickets. If you buy tickets on the bus you need the correct change.

The tram network does not go close to the conference venues but can be used to travel into town from the Airport [https://www.lothianbuses.com][lothian-bus].
