# Host your own IIIF event

Community members can **host local events** like workshops, meetings, and working groups. They can also submit proposals to **host the annual conference**. We have handy guides to help with both!

## Hosting a local event

Anyone can host a IIIF-related event in their region. You can use our short [guide to hosting an event]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/event/host_your_own_IIIF_event/) and <span style="text-decoration:underline;">marketing materials</span> (including pre-made “Introduction to IIIF” presentations). Plus, community members with firsthand experience put together thoughtful presentations and outlines to help you get started:

## Hosting the Annual Conference

The annual conference is the main in-person gathering for the community. The IIIF Consortium puts out a call for hosts each year. Take a look at a [previous event schedule]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/event/past_events/), and if you’re interested in hosting, read on to learn about the typical format (which, we should add, is open to modification):

**Day 1:**


<table>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Outreach showcase event</strong>
   </td>
   <td>Free and open to everyone, not just conference attendees, and ticketed separately from the main event. This part attracts 200-300 people and provides an introduction to IIIF and an update on the latest developments.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Workshops</strong>
   </td>
   <td>Attended by about 140 people total (workshops are for 30-40 people each). These can range from basic introductions to focused workshop sessions.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Executive Committee meeting</strong>
   </td>
   <td>20-30 participants from the Executive Committee meet in-person to discuss IIIF’s progress. This meeting lasts 3-4 hours and runs concurrent with the workshops.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Welcome reception</strong>
   </td>
   <td>Open to all 250-300 attendees.
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>


**Day 2:**


<table>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Plenary sessions</strong>
   </td>
   <td>250-300 people gather for an update on the community, specifications, and working groups, followed by a series of lightning talks.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Consortium reception</strong>
   </td>
   <td>Held for 100-150 attendees from IIIF Consortium member institutions.
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>


**Day 3 + 4 (if needed):**


<table>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Parallel tracks</strong>
   </td>
   <td>250-300 attendees select from three parallel tracks, held in rooms convenient to each other to allow movement between sessions and gathering during breaks.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Closing plenary session</strong>
   </td>
   <td>250-300 attendees gather to review emerging themes, hear closing announcements, and conclude the program with momentum into online meetings and other group efforts.
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>


**Other important details**



*   **Local planning contact:** The host provides a primary contact for the conference who serves on the event planning committee and provides knowledge and helps make local arrangements like reserving rooms and suggesting lunch restaurants.
*   **Travel:** Attendees come from Europe, North America, Asia, and other areas. The venue should be accessible by an international airport. Travel around the conference venues should be walkable or accessible via public transport.
*   **Hotels:** should be reasonably priced, and it’s helpful for them to be close to the conference venue. The conference hasn’t previously booked blocks of rooms in advance. Hosts supply a list of suitable hotels.
*   **Catering, breaks, and receptions:** Breaks are held twice daily and offer catered coffee, tea, and non-caffeinated beverages. They should take place in a central location where all attendees can come together to socialize between sessions. It is preferable to offer lunch for attendees, unless the cost is prohibitive. If not offered, a list of nearby restaurants is provided instead. Receptions are catered with beer, wine, and dinner.
*   **Ticket price:** The Consortium looks to cover the cost of running the conference, including catering, through ticket sales and sponsorship.
*   **Sponsorship:** Sponsors are typically acknowledged during the event, but an exhibition space is also a possibility.
*   **Attendee scholarships**: We seek to offer diversity scholarships to allow a more diverse range of people to attend.
*   **A/V and Wifi:** This is a technical conference with presenters giving live demos and showing videos. Requirements for this include:
    *   Wired ethernet connection for the presenter
    *   Wifi for conference participants, including external access to SSH (22), VPN and basic web access
    *   Laptop provided at the front of the room plus support for presenters to use their own laptops
    *   Projector with a large screen
    *   Large rooms will require handheld microphones for attendees to ask presenters questions
    *   Speakers to transmit audio will also be required for the showcase and plenary sessions and by arrangement for some parallel sessions.
*   **Video:** The showcase and lightning talks are video recorded, including the speaker and slides. The video files should be provided ready to upload to YouTube.
