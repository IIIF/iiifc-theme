## IIIF Showcase - Toronto - 2017

Join the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) community on Tuesday, October 10 at the University of Toronto for an evening showcase demonstrating the power and potential of interoperable image delivery on the Web, followed by a reception at the Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library. Embraced by a large and growing number of the worldâ€™s leading research and cultural heritage organizations, IIIF provides an open framework for publishing digital image-based resources, to be viewed, shared, cited, annotated, and more by any compatible image-viewing application. The program will provide an introduction to IIIF, exploring how institutions are leveraging IIIF to improve image delivery solutions, while simultaneously providing new and rich features and functionality for a world-class end user experience. As a community-driven initiative, we welcome anyone with an interest to participate in this growing movement and take advantage of the common framework.

This event will be valuable for organizational decision makers, repository and collection managers, software engineers; for cultural heritage or STEM (science / technology / engineering / medicine) institutions; or for anyone engaged with image-based resources on the Web. It is intended for people who have not been involved with IIIF in the past to quickly get up to speed and understand the community and its benefits.

This event will be conducted in English. Attendance is free, and widespread dissemination of the event is encouraged. [Registration][registration] is required in order to ensure that we do not exceed the capacity of the venue.
