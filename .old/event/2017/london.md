The Victoria & Albert Museum is hosting two IIIF events on Thursday, November 2, 2017. The morning Showcase is geared toward individuals and institutional representatives interested in learning about the basics and benefits of IIIF, while the afternoon technical workshop provides a forum for sharing among developers already working with IIIF.

## IIIF Showcase: Digital Collections in Dialogue

The IIIF Showcase brings together developers and early adopters to explain the background and value of IIIF, its growing community, and the potential of the Framework and the innovative ways in which it can be used to present digital image collections. The showcase will provide a short introduction to IIIF and then talks from various institutions and digital agencies using IIIF, including Edinburgh University Library, the National Library of Wales, the British Library, Digirati, Cogapp, Holoscene and the Victoria & Albert Museum, covering topics such as crowd-sourcing and IIIF, storytelling with IIIF, IIIF & 3D, IIIF communities of
interest, and how to get involved.
