*Are you willing to share your expertise and help grow the community as a conference mentor? Want to “pay it forward” and help someone else benefit from your experience?”*

*Do you feel like you could benefit from some insider knowledge about the community?*

IIIF has created a new framework for establishing relationships among our community members at the annual IIIF conferences. 

The program is meant to be lightweight, collegial, and mostly focused around the [annual IIIF conference][conference]. 

IIIF facilitates matches among community members, based on expertise and mentorship requests. 

Mentors agree to: 

- Meet up as early as possible at the IIIF conference, to be a friendly face, help make introductions, and generally advise on how to make the most of the conference.
- Maintain confidentiality and exhibit professionalism in all interactions, including by adhering to our [Code of Conduct][conduct]
- Make themselves available to chat a bit during coffee/tea breaks, or lunches

And of course, feel free to make yourself available beyond the expectations above if you have the time and inclination.

To become a peer mentor, or find one, let us know when you register by selecting the option you prefer. The conference program committee will then be in touch with interested participants about the next steps.
