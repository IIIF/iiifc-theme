# Case Study Examples

You can deliver images from any repository running a IIIF-compatible server and deliver structural info from somewhere else into one manifest.

See below for just a few live examples of the many ways that IIIF is used out in the wild.

## BVMM/BNF/Bibblissima Example

Bibliothèque virtuelle des manuscrits médiévaux (BVMM) has a book which has the illustrations cut out of it. They've made an integration with Gallica and The Bibliothèque nationale de France to digital reunite the illustrations with their containing pages.

[See the Mirador demo](https://demos.biblissima.fr/chateauroux/demo/) or the [Open SeaDragon demo](https://demos.biblissima.fr/chateauroux/osd-demo/) to see the recreation in action.

## Science Stories

Science Stories uses IIIF, Wikidata, and other tools to combine open resources into an elegant interface highlighting underrepresented women in science and math. This example illustrates the life and work of Grace Murray Hopper -- compare the diagram below with [the version on ScienceStories.io](http://www.sciencestories.io/Q11641).

## Center for Open Data in the Humanities (CODH)

Using the [Curation Viewer](http://codh.rois.ac.jp/software/iiif-curation-viewer/), part of the [Curation Platform](http://codh.rois.ac.jp/icp/#curation), the Center for Open Data in the Humanities (CODH) in Japan allows researchers to pull in resources from many institutions. [One example combines](http://codh.rois.ac.jp/software/iiif-curation-viewer/demo/index.html?curation=/curation/exhibition/1/json/inpicture.json&lang=en) elements on the topic of "Painting in Painting - the West and the East" with resources from Yale, the World Digital Library, and CODH.
