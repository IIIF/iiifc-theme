# Showcase 

Implementing IIIF provides flexibility and enables an amazing array of compelling user interactions. See below for a few examples ranging from basic image viewers up through IIIF-based machine learning character recognition, or take a look at the IIIF [viewers]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/showcase/iiif_viewers/), [servers]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/showcase/image_servers/) and [software tools] pages to dive deeper into how to construct examples like these.

You can also check out the [Awesome IIIF page on Github](https://github.com/IIIF/awesome-iiif){:.external}, a community-driven compendium of all things IIIF.


## Create possibilities with IIIF basics

**[Nationalmuseum Sweden](http://collection.nationalmuseum.se/eMP/eMuseumPlus?service=direct/1/ResultDetailView/result.inline.lightbox.t1.collection_lightbox.$TspTitleImageLink.link&sp=13&sp=Sexhibition&sp=SfilterDefinition&sp=0&sp=2&sp=3&sp=SdetailView&sp=11&sp=Sdetail&sp=1&sp=T&sp=0&sp=Slightbox_3x4&sp=0&sp=T&sp=1#exhibitionReferences)**

Nationalmuseum has implemented the IIIF Image API and the OpenSeadragon viewer, which allows smooth, deep zoom on images as well as the ability to easily switch out front end tools and back end systems.

**[Stanford University](https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/10384606)**


![stanford newspaper example]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/img/stanford newspaper.png "stanford newspaper example")


Stanford University has implemented the IIIF Image and Presentation APIs, which allow smooth, deep zoom on images and the ability to easily switch front end tools and back end systems, plus the ability to display multi-image objects such as the newspaper shown here, and work with them across sites and tools.


## Unite objects to enhance collections

**[Biblissima ](https://demos.biblissima.fr/chateauroux/osd-demo/)**

Manuscript 5 of the Municipal Library of Châteauroux (c. 1460) is a copy of the Grandes chroniques de France. At some point in history several illustrations were sadly cut from its pages and sold. Today, the manuscript is held in the digital collections of the Bibliothèque virtuelle des manuscrits médiévaux and the missing illustrations are held in the collection of the Bibliothèque nationale de France. Both institutions make their collections openly available via IIIF, allowing Biblissima, a portal for manuscript research, to digitally reunite the missing illustrations with their pages so researchers can view them as inte.

**[Sciencestories.io](http://www.sciencestories.io/Q450317?moment=0)** 

![science stories example]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/img/science stories 1.png "science stories example")

![science stories example]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/img/science stories 2.png "science stories example")


Science Stories assembles digitized resources from diverse collections to highlight the research and experiences of historical and contemporary scientists. In this example, IIIF-enabled photographs from the Smithsonian Institute Archives and National Portrait Gallery (US) show physicist Chien-Shiung Wu at work, alongside videos about her work and a timeline of her career. Each resource links back to its source repository, providing opportunities for further exploration.


## Contextualize with annotations

[EdX Cell Biology course](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+MCB64.1x+2T2016/d16e07a5cec442eeb7cd9dfcb695dce0/)

![harvard edx example]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/img/harvard edx 1.png "harvard edx example")

![harvard edx example]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/img/harvard edx 2.png "harvard edx example")


Harvard University is using IIIF to enhance their EdX course offerings. Here, the Mirador viewer displays an image of a cell with IIIF annotations to show its parts, allowing students to zoom in and out to see the relative size of each of the parts compared to the whole of the cell. Each session focuses on different cell parts, and the viewer brings students to the corresponding area of the image when students view the course pages for different sessions.

**[KuroNet Cursive Script Recognition Viewer](http://codh.rois.ac.jp/char-shape/app/icv-kuzushiji/?manifest=http://codh.rois.ac.jp/char-shape/book/100249371/manifest.json&pos=41&lang=en)**


![KuroNet viewer]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/img/kurushiji ai.png "KuroNet Viewer screenshot")


Many historical Japanese materials are written in kuzushiji, a form of cursive writing that most Japanese people can’t read today. Using this tool, a researcher can highlight characters in a IIIF-enabled kuzushiji document and AI-driven cursive Optical Character Recognition (OCR) suggests the characters likely to be depicted, allowing easy reading.

**[Exhibit.so ](https://exhibit.so/)**


![Exhibit screenshot]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/img/exhibit 1.png "Exhibit screenshot")

Exhibit is an educational tool developed by the University of St Andrews and Mnemoscene in response to the sudden switch to remote teaching at the start of the 2020 global pandemic. It allows users to easily develop guided annotation experiences for individual or grouped IIIF resources. In this example, annotations guide the viewer through images illustrating Edweard Muybridge’s accidental creation of the first motion picture in the 1880’s. While the tool was developed for faculty at the University to use in teaching, they have made the tool openly available, and it works with any IIIF-enabled resource.
