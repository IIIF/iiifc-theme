### Diversity fellowship seats

The IIIF Consortium is committed to being accessible, inclusive, and reducing barriers for people who want to learn about the Framework. That’s why we make seats available in every workshop at no cost to encourage participation from a more diverse body of community members and institutions. 

If your institution does not have funding for training opportunities and you count yourself among the groups listed below, then these fellowship seats are available to you:

*   People of color, ability/disability, non-binary gender identities, etc.
*   Participants from under-represented countries or geographic regions, such as (but not limited to) the Global South
*   Members of underrepresented and/or marginalized groups that don’t fit into the categories listed above

These tickets are first-come, first-served, and made available by the honor system; we do not require any documentation of any kind to claim these tickets. To claim a fellowship seat, register for the workshop and select the “fellowship ticket” option.
