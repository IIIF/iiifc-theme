![IIIF Göttingen Conference 2019]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/img/2019-06-26-IIIF-Group--3.jpg "Göttingen Conference 2019")


Scholars, software people, researchers, and culture workers are the types who tend to gravitate around IIIF, and everything we do is guided by our **[code of conduct]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/event/conduct/)**.

Overall, we think there are [hundreds of adopters]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/community/map) of IIIF all around the world, at libraries, museums, archives, universities, and some companies, too.

There are four main ways to join the conversation:



1. Sign up for the **[newsletter](https://iiif.io/newsletter/#newsletter-signup)** - news about events, training, cool projects, and community updates
2. Jump on one of the **[community calls]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/community/call/)** - friendly, regular calls with interested folk, from beginners to experts
3. Subscribe to the **[iiif-discuss mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/iiif-discuss)**{:.external} - more technical, Q&A, project-related
4. Join the **[IIIF Slack](http://bit.ly/iiif-slack)**{:.external} team - lots of activity, specific channels for groups, and more!

There are **[groups]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/community/groups/)** to discuss various elements or contexts of IIIF usage or to agree on direction (or not!) of a particular idea or initiative. Some things in IIIF require slightly more formal governance, which happens through five **[committees]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/community/consortium/#committees)**. For example, the [Technical Review Committee]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/community/consortium/trc) is the committee responsible for the IIIF APIs.

## About the IIIF Consortium

IIIF is supported by a membership **[consortium]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/community/consortium)**, with members from all over the world including Stanford University, Europeana, Kansai University, and many more.

You can **[join the consortium]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/community/consortium/join/)** as a _full_ or _associate member_. Consortium members can access customized training, and have voting rights on the overall direction of the framework via the [Technical Review Committee]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/community/trc/) or <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Executive Committee</span>. The consortium has [staff]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/community/consortium/staff), who are stewards looking after the community, organizing events and training, and helping things run smoothly.
