# IIIF Coordinating Committee

The IIIF Coordinating Committee (CoCo) is composed of both IIIF-C members and non-members to represent constituents throughout the community. The group should be large enough to generate ideas and energy for building a strong corps of IIIF leaders spanning all sectors, allowing for continuity over time, and regularly cycling in new leaders to bring a diversity of perspectives. The Coordinating Committee actively and continuously engages in maintaining and supporting the inclusion of a wide variety of persons and institutions with varying backgrounds, each of whom/which share a devotion to the fundamental purposes of the International Image Interoperability Framework.  The Coordinating Committee comprises the following members:


### Standing members

*   Committee Chair: IIIF-C Managing Director
*   IIIF Technology Coordinator
*   IIIF Community and Events Coordinator

### Rotating representatives

*   Active representatives from each of the standing groups:
    *   Editors Group x2
    *   Code of Conduct Team x1
    *   Outreach group x1
*   One active representative from each of the community and technical specification groups (potentially a chair, but not a requirement):
    *   Museums community group
    *   Manuscripts community group
    *   Newspapers community group
    *   Software Development community group
    *   3D community group
    *   Archives community group
    *   Discovery for Humans community group
    *   Maps community group
    *   Audio/Visual technical specification group
    *   Text granularity technical specification group
    *   Discovery technical specification group  
*   Four general community representatives, to be invited by IIIF-C staff from among active community participants

### Other

*   When additional community groups are proposed, representatives will be added to the Coordinating Committee unless and until there are 12 total community + technical groups at which time the Managing Director may propose an alternative mechanism for community/technical group representation
*   The Managing Director may choose to invite additional members at any time for up to one year for specific purposes, such as:
    *   Event Program Committee Members (such as local hosts or program committee chairs)
    *   Other community, management, or domain expertise
*   If for any reason there are not at least two representatives from IIIF-C member institutions among the above positions excluding standing members, then the Operating Committee may name an additional representative to the group.

## Scope

The agenda for each meeting is compiled by the Managing Director and other IIIF-C staff, with support from the other committee members, based on issues raised in communication forums and topics related to:

*   Assessing proposals for new community and technical groups
*   Advising on strategic planning and communication across IIIF groups
*   Advising on strategies for diverse representation across the IIIF community
*   Discussing and advising on best practices for evolving communication
*   De-briefing on and assessing success of IIIF events, conferences and working meetings
*   Advising on location selection and timing of meetings
*   Ratify revisions to the Code of Conduct (as proposed by the Code of Conduct team)
*   Recommending policy additions or revisions where appropriate
*   Monitoring and supporting the health of community groups

The Managing Director and other IIIF staff will serve as liaisons to the [Executive Committee]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/community/consortium/).
