## Rationale

3D capture is gaining wide traction across interdisciplinary communities as technologies have improved.  Much development of 3D applications is siloed, and cutting-edge activities are largely happening outside the library and cultural heritage realm. 3D data cover a wide-range of file formats and applications for research and outreach.

A IIIF 3D community group provides an opportunity for institutions interested in interoperability to coordinate strategies and facilitate conversations about open standards that support 3D use cases. Many of the desired operations and interactions with 3D data are similar to the 2D and A/V use cases of IIIF for sharing images and annotation, and organizations are increasingly looking to integrate exhibits, displays, and comparisons of 3D data with other file types. 

This community group is not a technical working group and will not produce IIIF specifications or technical recommendations. The purpose of this group is to bring those interested together, from both within and beyond existing IIIF participants, to develop coordinated strategies and exploration of possibilities for 3D data and applications. Further, it exists as a rallying point for engaging with the broader web community to promote interoperability and standards within browsers and applications. We hope and expect participation in this group from cultural heritage organizations, industry experts, researchers in computer graphics and related disciplines, the scientific imaging community and others. 

## Goals

 * To explore possibilities for viewing, search, discovery, and annotating 3D data.
 * To collect and document use cases from existing and new IIIF community members that suggest the need for interoperability of 3D data.
 * To collect, discuss and evaluate the state of the art with respect to 3D requirements for use by the cultural heritage community on the web. 
 * To coordinate and connect through outreach to internal and external partners and technical experts, and related initiatives. 
 * To explore best practices for interoperability and possibilities with existing IIIF specifications and open APIs through articulating use cases and experimentation.
