# How groups work

IIIF groups are designed to foster collaboration in specific areas of interest. They operate with transparency as a primary goal, and according to the IIIF [Code of Conduct]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/event/conduct).

There are two different types of IIIF groups:



1. **Community Groups (CG)** \
Discussion, collaboration and coordinated work around existing APIs, producing tutorials, gathering demos, and sharing knowledge about particular areas of interest. CGs tend to be ongoing.

2. **Technical Specification Groups (TSG)**  \
For high-quality work toward specific, agreed-upon goals to either improve existing APIs or create new ones. They often have a limited lifespan that connects with finishing the work they’re set up to do.

IIIF groups aim to:

*   Be lightweight
*   Ensure visibility of ongoing work
*   Enable new group members to get started quickly
*   Support development of products by the community
*   Make decisions fairly and transparently

Groups work well if they:

*   Engage with the wider IIIF community to understand and meet real requirements
*   Develop code or resources using agreed processes and timeframes
*   Encourage participation actively, and openly support new participants


## How IIIF groups communicate


*   **[IIIF-Discuss](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/iiif-discuss)** email list
    *   Please note your group when you’re posting on IIIF-Discuss, e.g. [av] for the A/V group, or [newspapers] for the Newspapers group
    *   Even though you may need a separate, specific email group, please start with IIIF-Discuss, so all community members can stay up to date
    *   New group-specific lists should only be formed if there’s too much traffic in the main list
    *   A new group email list should be iiif-(topic)@googlegroups.com, and include at least one IIIF staff member
*   **[Slack](http://iiif.slack.com/)**
    *   Feel free to create an open channel for your group
*   **Community calls**
    *   Group calls should be held on a regular schedule, which you can see on the IIIF [calendar](https://iiif.io/community/groups/)
    *   A IIIF [staff]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/community/consortium/staff/) member can help set up calls for you
*   **[Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B9EeoRu2zWeraXpHNXpnZThUZVE)** is the place for any/all group-related documents, particularly call notes
*   **[GitHub](https://github.com/IIIF)** is widely used within IIIF for code, documentation and issue tracking
*   IIIF in-person working meetings are welcomed whenever that’s a possibility


## Creating a new group

Groups emerge quite naturally from discussion that usually starts on IIIF-Discuss, on Slack, or at events, and ideally, their focus and scope are shaped through that discussion.

**Community Groups** tend to be more lightweight, so can be initiated by sending an email to [admin@iiif.io](mailto:admin@iiif.io) outlining the proposed group’s topics and objectives, and who the initial members and chair(s) will be. Staff will forward the proposal to the Coordinating Committee for review, and if it’s approved the new group will be added to the iiif.io website, a Google Drive folder will be made, and the call schedule will be announced. At least three organizations need to be represented in any community group, and anyone can join.

**Technical Specification Groups** need to be formally initiated using a Google document that outlines which domain the group is about (e.g. Audio/Visual), the needs and requirements within that domain, several use cases about those needs, starter specifications, any known complementary implementations, which organizations are able to commit resources, and a realistic timeframe for implementing it all. That document should be sent to [admin@iiif.io](mailto:admin@iiif.io) for initial approval by the Coordination Committee.

TSGs also require final approval by the wider IIIF community, which IIIF staff facilitate. When that wider announcement goes out, the group will be created if three or more organizations support it. If three or more members _do not_ support it, the group will need to be reassessed. Recruiting new group members is encouraged at this point.

## Guidelines for groups

*   Group details must be kept up to date on iiif.io
*   Group charters should be kept up to date
*   Groups must always have at least one Chair, preferably two or three.
*   A Chair is responsible for promoting group activities, but doesn’t get special powers
*   A group can change its Chair(s) by consensus
*   Group discussion must be transparent and made available in the group’s Google folder
*   All group members should work together to ensure transparency of group activities. Like, don’t make the same person take notes every call
*   Make sure plenty of notice is given to members for meetings that fall outside the regular call schedule
*   Significant changes in any group’s plans, like a six month delay, should be announced to the wider community
*   If a group stops responding to community interest for three months, it will be dissolved
*   If a TSG is proposing API changes, two members of the Editorial Committee are required to participate in it
*   Any work contributed via a TSG must be licensed under CC-BY or similar


## Dissolving an existing group

When a group closes, all group documents or Github issues, etc, will be left alive, and either chair(s) or staff should leave a note on the main group document(s) to let everyone know the group is no longer active.

**Community Groups** can be dissolved if members decide the group is no longer needed.

**TSGs** can be dissolved if all deliverables have been delivered, if the group becomes inactive, doesn’t have members from three or more member organisations, doesn’t have two Editorial Committee members, or no Chair.
