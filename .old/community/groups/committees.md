# Committees

The IIIF committees are more formal than groups, since committees exist to make decisions, lead on direction, and provide oversight. There is more information on how committees are operated in [About the IIIF Consortium]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/community/consortium/).

There are two committees designed to represent the needs of the community:

*   [Coordinating Committee]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/community/coordinating_committee) - an advisory body made up of community group representatives and others that provides feedback and maintains week-to-week communications about all things IIIF
*   [Editorial Committee]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/community/editors/) - creates and actively maintains API specifications

The other three committees are explicitly connected to the [IIIF Consortium]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/community/consortium/) for governance.
