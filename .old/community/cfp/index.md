## Call for Implementations

The International Image Interoperability Framework community is inviting proposals for funding of open source implementations or other work that would improve the state of the community, particularly implementations that make existing software interoperable.  Proposals should be sent to [iiif-proposals@googlegroups.com](mailto:iiif-proposals@googlegroups.com) at any time, up until June 1, 2016.  Proposals will be assessed when they are received and thus the earlier proposals are submitted, the more likely they are to be funded.  The proposal process is intended to ensure openness, quality and timeliness.

The proposal should be a 1-2 page PDF document that outlines the following:

  * The proposed work to be done, including the open source license to be applied
  * Who will do the work
  * When the work will be completed, with a latest possible date of November 30th 2016
  * A rationale for why the work should be done, and why the proposing team is well placed to carry out the work
  * How much support from the IIIF fund is needed, and how much will be provided by the proposing institution or individual

Once received, proposals will be reviewed by a team and a response provided within two to three weeks. The review team initially consists of:

  * Tom Cramer (IIIF Consortium)
  * Rob Sanderson (Stanford)
  * Jon Stroop, Shaun Ellis (Princeton)
  * Simeon Warner (Cornell)
  * Randy Stern, Rashmi Singhal (Harvard)
  * Matthew McGrattan (Oxford)

Further volunteers from the community are sought for the review team. Institutions that have members on the review team are not eligible to submit proposals, each institution only contributes one review, and the final decision for any proposal will be made by Stanford University Libraries, after the review process.

Reviews will be based on the following weighted criteria

  * Benefit to the community (35%)
  * Relevance to IIIF focus  (30%)
  * Cost to value ratio (20%)
  * Likelihood of success (15%)

The response may be:

  * Everything looks great, we'll figure out the contract with you
  * Please provide refinements in specified areas, or answers to questions
  * Apologies but the proposed work doesn't fit the criteria sufficiently

The range of available funds is up to $20,000 USD per project, however for projects of extraordinary quality with significant matching funds, exceptions may be made.  If requesting more than this amount, please contact the team in advance at [iiif-proposals@googlegroups.com](mailto:iiif-proposals@googlegroups.com).

__Please circulate to other parties that may be interested!__
