## IIIF Support for Grant Proposals

As a community-based initiative, IIIF welcomes innovation and advances from any participant; grants from funding agencies can play an important role in driving progress for individual institutions and the community at large. In recognition of this, the IIIF community encourages grants and may endorse proposals on request. To receive official support from IIIF, however, proposals must demonstrate some benefit to IIIF and a commitment to participating with the IIIF community as part of the project. This document lays out the expectations that the IIIF community has for grant proposals, and the process for obtaining a letter of recommendation from the [IIIF Consortium][iiif-c] (IIIF-C).

If members of a IIIF community or technical specification group wish to submit a letter of support for a grant, the letter should clearly state that support is on behalf of the individuals/institutions signing, not on behalf of IIIF-C, the IIIF community, or a IIIF group as a whole. If members of a group wish to use IIIF letterhead, the letter must be reviewed via the process outlined below and endorsed by the IIIF-C.

**Expectations for Grant Proposals**

For grant proposals to be endorsed by the IIIF Consortium, they should follow these guidelines.
The proposed project should:

 * relate directly to existing IIIF specifications, software, content or community. The proposed benefits should be relevant to the goals of the IIIF community.
 * be explicit that any software produced as part of the grant that falls within the scope of IIIF specifications will comply with those specifications as written.  The Consortium has a preference for Open Source software, however this is not required. Contributions to existing software projects, when appropriate and possible, are also welcome.
 * be for a project that enriches IIIF, such as by making content available via IIIF, or producing openly accessible data, software or services that leverage or increase the value of existing IIIF content.
 * clearly include the participation of the grantees in the IIIF community.
 * commit to following existing processes and norms established within the IIIF community, including those processes around community discussion, the creation or extension of specifications, and interactions via open community and technical groups.
 * be explicit that requirements for any extensions be discussed with the IIIF community, via its regular channels (IIIF-Discuss email list, Slack, community calls).

 **Process for Letters of Support**

 * Initial public or private discussion with members of the community is encouraged early and often. Engagement with the IIIF community is preferred prior to asking for a letter of support.
 * Requests should be made to the IIIF Consortium (IIIF-C) Staff, at <admin@iiif.io> as early as possible, and no later than 2 weeks in advance of the application deadline. Early and frequent discussion with the IIIF Coordinating Committee is encouraged to allow time for iterations and to avoid missed deadlines.
 * The request should contain sufficient supporting information to justify the endorsement of the Consortium according to the guidelines above.
 * The request must include sufficient information to complete the letter of support, such as the contact details for the granting agency, the program under which the application will be submitted, the deadlines for the submission and so forth.
 * IIIF staff will review the request and provide feedback.  The typical time for this feedback is 2-4 weeks. Once the letter is approved, the IIIF Managing Director will issue a signed letter of support on IIIF letterhead. When desirable and appropriate, the letter may also be co-signed by IIIF community members. If a physical copy is required, please allow additional time, otherwise it will be provided as a PDF document.

 **Limitations of Endorsement**

Any support or endorsement is provided by the IIIF Consortium as an entity, and does not imply support for the application from any particular individual or IIIF Consortium member institution.

The policy and procedures outlined in this document are subject to change by IIIF-C and the Coordinating Committee over time, and will be reviewed and updated as needed.
