## Agenda for IIIF 2015-

The Executive Committee requests the Coordinating Committee to use the points below to build a roadmap to guide the activities of IIIFC for the coming years, revisiting the roadmap regularly to keep it aligned with community interests and needs.

## Community Development

  * Accelerate & facilitate the adoption and deployment of IIIF APIs at institutions publishing content, especially targeting major holding institutions from Libraries, Archives, Museums and Galleries (near term)
  * Accelerate & facilitate the uptake of IIIF API support in new and existing open source and commercial software packages, including transcription tools (near term)
  * Conduct public relations and marketing campaign to promote awareness of IIIF as a framework (near term). This includes
    * assembling demonstrations of IIIF solutions in action that illustrate its value to multiple levels of stakeholders, from users to senior leaders at major institutions; including demonstrations and metrics of impact;
    * enhancing the IIIF.io website with accessible and useful information;
    * conducting proactive outreach and dissemination.
  * Develop and launch a IIIF interest group structure to foster the ongoing exchange of knowledge and progress towards work product in specific communities of interest (near term)
  * Identify and cooperate with communities and initiatives with complementary members and objectives, including the Open Annotation and Web communities, standards bodies, technology providers, and cultural heritage organizations / services (such as Europeana and DPLA) (medium term)
  * Apply IIIF to additional domains in like communities and content types (books, newspapers, journals, maps, music, museum objects, scrolls, archives). Seed the development of IIIF-based interest groups to catalyze further adoption, gathering of use cases, exposing more content, and attracting more software & solution providers to the Framework (medium term)
  * Identify a host institution to help support IIIF activities with financial, organizational, administrative and other activities (medium term)
  * Organize a more structured and sustainable community infrastructure to support and advance IIIF over the long term (ongoing)

## API Specification

  * Authentication / Authorization: extend the framework to support interoperability for access-controlled resources (near term)
  * Search within an object; define strategies--including API extensions and reference implementations--for supporting textual search within a resource--such as of full text or text-based annotations, effectively extending IIIF support to books and newspapers (among other resources) (near term)
  * Support and patterns for conveying attribution and licensing via IIIF (near term)
  * Discovery of IIIF-compatible resources: enabling the ability to find interoperable, IIIF-based materials from the open web for local use (near term).
  * Support for full management (create, edit, delete--not just read/view) via APIs for IIIF resources (manifests, images & annotations) (medium term)
  * Creation, management and visualization of 3rd party annotations relative to IIIF-based resources (medium term)
  * Support for physical (museum) objects and collections (medium term)
  * Support for time-based media (audio/video) (long term)
  * Updates to image and presentation APIs based on community adoption and feedback (ongoing)
  * Investigate and instantiate a method or methods of assessing and reporting use of resources delivered by IIIF APIs from individual holding institutions 

## Utilities & Adoption Aids

Generally make IIIF easy to use and deploy, including through: 

  * Gather and promote reference implementations, that illustrate IIIF content and services for new and potential adopters (near term)
  * Documentation: create and maintain "why IIIF", "getting started", "how to", and like documentation to facilitate adoption (near term)
  * Training: develop tutorials and a training program (including possibly train-the-trainers, retaining training vendors, developing regional centers of excellence, and pursuing training development grants) to facilitate IIIF uptake by adopters. (near term)
  * Validators: create, enhance and maintain services that validate IIIF endpoints, services, content and software (medium term)
  * Manifest creation / editing / conversion tools: Develop, enhance and maintain tools enabling sites to produce IIIF-compatible resources (medium term)
  * Develop and maintain a registry of IIIF endpoints to facilitate discovery of IIIF resources (medium term)
